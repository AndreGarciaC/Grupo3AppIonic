Young Bruce was comforted by <a href=\"..\/..\/leslie-thompkins\/29-3740\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Leslie Thompkins<\/a>, who helped him to mourn his parents and find a purpose in life. At age fourteen, Bruce started a twelve-year walkabout around the world seeking experts in many fields, training himself mentally and physically. From an academic standpoint, he studied at Cambridge in <a href=\"\/england\/4020-55794\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55794\">England<\/a>, the Sorbonne in <a href=\"\/france\/4020-55778\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55778\">France,<\/a> and other famous European universities.

Bruce saw this as an omen and recalled his fear of bats as a child. This would be his symbol; the Bat would strike terror into the Gotham underworld.

After the success of <a href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman<\/a> in early 1939, <a href=\"\/dc-comics\/4010-10\/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics<\/a> started requesting more superheroes for its titles. Bob Kane had an idea for a character called \"Bat-Man.\" There is a large controversy that suggests Kane came up with a \"Birdman\" and Finger is the one who actually suggested the name \"Bat-man.\" The character's alter-ego's name was influenced by the names of the Scottish patriot Robert the Bruce and revolutionary U.S. Brigadier General Mad Anthony Wayne (who, in the comics, is an ancestor of Bruce). For the character's costume, <a href=\"\/bob-kane\/4040-19137\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-19137\">Kane<\/a> drew inspiration from a flying device designed by Leonardo da Vinci: the ornithopter, a glider that had bat-like wings.<\/p><p>Most of the Bat costume designs were suggested by <a href=\"\/bill-finger\/4040-43591\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43591\">Bill Finger<\/a>. Kane initially drew Batman with a red and black costume, a domino mask, and wings. Finger suggested the character's costume be coloured black and grey to make the character look more \"ominous.\" He also suggested replacing the domino mask with a \"cowl\" (hood) and the wings with a cape. Finger also wanted Kane to change the way Batman's eyes appeared behind the mask and urged him to turn them into white spots. Later Finger admitted that he was influenced by the comic character <a href=\"..\/..\/the-phantom\/29-7957\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Phantom<\/a>, who also wore a mask with no visible pupils. Gloves were also added so that Batman would not leave fingerprints behind.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2047033\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.385\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2047033\"><img alt=\"Batman's First appearance\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" data-width=\"462\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman's First appearance\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2047033-detective_comics_super.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" data-width=\"462\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman's First appearance<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Like <a href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman<\/a>, various aspects of Batman's personality, character history, visual design and equipment were inspired by a contemporary popular culture of the 1930's, including movies, pulp magazine, comic strips, newspaper headlines, and even aspects of Kane himself. Notable sources of inspiration were two of Kane's favourite movies, <em>The Bat Whispers<\/em> (1930), the film was a screen adaptation of Mary Robert Rinehart's mystery novel that featured a character named The Bat, a detective who has a secret alter ego known as the Bat. The other movie that influenced Kane was <em>The Mark Of Zorro<\/em> (1920). One might point out that in the movies young Bruce Wayne is often shown to have seen a <a href=\"..\/..\/zorro\/29-15896\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zorro<\/a> movie before his parents were murdered. The character first appeared in <em><a href=\"..\/..\/detective-comics-the-case-of-the-chemical-syndicate\/37-105764\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detective Comics #27<\/a><\/em>, published in 1939, and later became popular enough to spawn his own comics. Along with <a href=\"..\/..\/superman\/29-1807\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/wonder-woman\/29-2048\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wonder Woman<\/a>, Batman has provided many of the core story arcs for the DC brand since his creation.<\/p><p>Batman is unique for the simple reason that he has no super-human powers and is an ordinary human employing an M.O., a <em>modus operandi,<\/em> and relying on his intelligence, money, inventiveness, detective skills, martial arts, and fear to defeat his opponents. He currently makes the most money for a single publishing character and is widely considered to be one of the most popular super-heroes in all of comics.<\/p><p>In the original version of the story and the vast majority of retellings, Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American millionaire (later billionaire) playboy, industrialist, and philanthropist. Having witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered with the greater ideal of justice. Wayne trains himself both physically and intellectually and dons a bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional American Gotham City, assisted by various supporting characters including his crime-fighting partner, Robin, his butler Alfred Pennyworth, the police commissioner James W. Gordon, and occasionally the heroine Batgirl. He fights an assortment of villains such as the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, Ra's al Ghul, the Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, and the Catwoman, among others. Unlike most superheroes, he does not possess any super-human powers; he makes use of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth, physical prowess, martial arts skills, an indomitable will, fear, and intimidation in his continuous war on crime.<\/p><p>Batman became a very popular character soon after his introduction and gained his own comic book title, Batman, in 1940. As the decades wore on, differing interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s Batman television series used a \"camp\" (actually action-comedy) aesthetic which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, with varying results. The comic books of this dark stage culminated in the acclaimed 1986 miniseries <em>The Dark Knight Returns,<\/em> written by Frank Miller, as well as <em>Batman: The Killing Joke,<\/em> written by Alan Moore. and <em>Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth,<\/em> among others. The overall success of <a href=\"\/warner-brothers\/4010-574\/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-574\">Warner Brothers'<\/a> live-action Batman feature films has also helped maintain public interest in the character. (Warner Brothers' parent company, Warner Communications, became the parent company of <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/dc-comics\/4010-10\/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics<\/a> in the 1970s.)<\/p><h3>Pulp Influences<\/h3><p>Batman, as a character, was heavily influenced by \"pulp\" magazines, cheaply-printed prose magazines that were a popular form of mass entertainment in the first half of the twentieth century. Pulp genres varied from romance to horror, but mysterious heroes featured heavily. And as Bill Finger later said, Batman was originally written in pulp style. One famous pulp character that inspired both Finger and Kane--in different mediums--was <a href=\"..\/..\/the-shadow\/29-28923\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Shadow<\/a>. Finger liked the magazine version of the character: a gun-toting, no-nonsense crime fighter whose real identity was a mystery. Kane preferred the radio version of The Shadow: a wealthy playboy named Lamont Cranston who had the hypnotic power \"to cloud men's minds,\" to prevent them from seeing him.<\/p><h2>Character Evolution<\/h2><h3>Golden Age<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2317812\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.11\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2317812\"><img alt=\"Golden Age Batman\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" data-width=\"576\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Golden Age Batman\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317812-114472_76468_batman_super.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" data-width=\"576\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Golden Age Batman<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>During the <a href=\"..\/..\/golden-age-of-comics\/12-55820\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Golden Age of Comics<\/a>, when he was first introduced, Bruce Wayne was already the vigilante known as Batman. Batman's first appearance was in <em><a href=\"\/millennium-edition-detective-comics-27\/4050-32756\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-32756\">Detective Comics #27<\/a><\/em>. In <em><a href=\"..\/..\/detective-comics-\/37-112065\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detective Comics #33<\/a><\/em>, the origin of the character was told. Bruce Wayne was the son of <a href=\"..\/..\/thomas-wayne\/29-3602\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thomas Wayne<\/a> and his wife, <a href=\"..\/..\/martha-wayne\/29-3603\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martha Wayne<\/a>. His parents were wealthy philanthropists in the high society of <a href=\"..\/..\/gotham-city\/34-23611\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gotham City<\/a>. Bruce grew up in <a href=\"..\/..\/wayne-manor\/34-55767\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wayne Manor<\/a> and experienced a privileged life until one fateful night. Bruce and his parents went to the movies and were walking home when suddenly they were confronted by a gun-toting small-time crook called <a href=\"..\/..\/joe-chill\/29-32672\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joe Chill<\/a>. At first, Chill demanded <a href=\"\/martha-wayne\/4005-3603\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3603\">Martha<\/a>'s jewellery, but instead, he ended up shooting and killing both of Bruce\u2019s parents. After the deaths of his parents, Bruce swore to rid <a href=\"..\/..\/gotham-city\/34-23611\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gotham City<\/a> of evil forever. He began an intense mental and physical training and mastered many skills including martial arts, criminology, and escape artistry.<\/p><p>Upon completing his training Bruce realized that his skills alone were not enough to do the job; he needed the criminals to fear him. That was when a bat flew through the window, scaring Bruce. He was inspired by the symbolism of the bat and used this to become Batman. Batman witnessed the death of the <a href=\"\/flying-graysons\/4060-55863\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55863\">Flying Graysons<\/a>, high-flying acrobats that were killed by mobsters after the owner of the circus refused to pay \"protection money\" for the crooks to be their bodyguards. Bruce takes in young <a href=\"..\/..\/dick-grayson\/29-1691\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dick Grayson<\/a> as his ward and trains him as his protege, <a href=\"..\/..\/robin\/29-1687\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robin<\/a>. Bruce and <a href=\"\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick<\/a> first hunt down and defeat <a href=\"\/anthony-zucco\/4005-22815\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22815\">Tony Zucco<\/a>, the crime boss who had been responsible for the deaths of <a href=\"\/john-grayson\/4005-6844\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6844\">John<\/a> and <a href=\"\/mary-grayson\/4005-38117\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38117\">Mary Grayson<\/a>. It is never stated why Bruce took in <a href=\"..\/..\/dick-grayson\/29-1691\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dick<\/a>, but it could be due to how <a href=\"..\/..\/dick-grayson\/29-1691\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dick<\/a> lost his parents at a young age, and to crime, just like Bruce. Together the \"<a href=\"..\/..\/the-dynamic-duo\/65-56496\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dynamic Duo<\/a>\" face off against many enemies such as the <a href=\"..\/..\/riddler\/29-3718\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Riddler<\/a>, the <a href=\"..\/..\/scarecrow\/29-3726\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarecrow<\/a>, the <a href=\"..\/..\/penguin\/29-4885\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Penguin<\/a>, and the <a href=\"..\/..\/joker\/29-1702\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joker<\/a>, the last of whom was to become Batman's greatest enemy.<\/p><p>Batman eventually becomes one of the founding members of the <a href=\"..\/..\/justice-society-of-america\/65-27589\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice Society of America<\/a>. Batman continued working with the <a href=\"..\/..\/gotham-city-police-department\/65-42090\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gotham City Police Department<\/a> in fighting crime and is later legally deputized as a civilian police agent. Later <a href=\"..\/..\/alfred\/29-5556\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alfred Pennyworth<\/a> is introduced and serves as his butler. Alfred eventually learns the identities of the Dynamic Duo and aids them in keeping their identity safe. Love interest <a href=\"..\/..\/vicki-vale\/29-8264\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vicki Vale<\/a> debuted during the 1940's as one of the numerous \"flavours of the month\" for Bruce Wayne. (Other heroes were shown to have <em><strong>a<\/strong><\/em> girlfriend. But this could not be so with Bruce Wayne; to say that he was a playboy was to mean it. In his various incarnations, he has had a number of girlfriends, but none have lasted long, and his Batman incarnation was too obsessed and too angst-consumed to be able to commit to anyone; besides, Batman had been specifically created to be more of a fighter than any true lover.) Vicki was created as a mirror of <a href=\"..\/..\/lois-lane\/29-1808\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lois Lane<\/a> of <a href=\"..\/..\/metropolis\/34-41184\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metropolis<\/a>, and she often spent her time trying to figure out the identity of Batman. Whenever she got close to figuring out that Batman was Bruce Wayne, Batman would often trick her into believing he was <em><strong>not<\/strong><\/em> Bruce Wayne. (Secret identities nearly being found out was a common occurrence in the Golden Age.) Batman was first shown as a cold-blooded vigilante who was willing to use a gun and kill his enemies to rid the city of crime. But this revolted some readers, who made it clear that they <em><strong>hated<\/strong><\/em> the idea of their hero going around killing people. At the same time, DC Comic's new editor, Whitney Ellsworth, was already drafting, and eventually implemented, a moral code for Batman that prevented him from ever killing or using a gun. One in-comics rationale for this was that having witnessed his parents being killed with guns was enough to turn him against their usage.<\/p><h3>Silver Age<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2317813\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.2790178571429\" data-width=\"448\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 448px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2317813\"><img alt=\"Silver Age Batman\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg 448w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Silver Age Batman\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/83882\/2317813-20100406012608_batman_silver_age_001.jpg 448w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Silver Age Batman<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>During the <a href=\"..\/..\/silver-age-of-comics\/12-55821\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silver Age<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/dc-comics\/57-10\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DC Comics<\/a> introduced the <a href=\"..\/..\/the-dc-multiverse\/12-43603\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Multiverse<\/a> continuity to its characters. It established the fact that all the Batman stories told during the Golden Age actually took place on Earth-Two. The Earth-Two Batman marries <a href=\"..\/..\/catwoman\/29-1698\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Catwoman<\/a> and fathered a daughter named <a href=\"..\/..\/helena-wayne\/29-45563\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Helena Wayne<\/a> who grows up to be the <a href=\"..\/..\/huntress\/29-1690\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Huntress<\/a>.

Batman's backstory was expanded upon to include his uncle, Philip Wayne, who raised Bruce for a while after his parent's deaths. He also had an older brother named <a href=\"..\/..\/thomas-wayne\/29-3602\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thomas Wayne<\/a> Jr., who had had to be institutionalized after the death of <a href=\"\/thomas-wayne\/4005-3602\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3602\">Thomas<\/a> and <a href=\"\/martha-wayne\/4005-3603\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3603\">Martha<\/a>. In addition, it was revealed that his parents' killings had not been chance, but instead an assassination ordered by gangster <a href=\"..\/..\/lew-moxon\/29-18944\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lew Moxon<\/a>.<\/p><p>As a child, Bruce's father had worn a bat costume (similar to Batman's future costume) to a masquerade party, where he encountered and stopped the mobster. <a href=\"\/lew-moxon\/4005-18944\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18944\">Moxon<\/a> swore revenge against <a href=\"..\/..\/thomas-wayne\/29-3602\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Wayne<\/a> and hired <a href=\"\/joe-chill\/4005-32672\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32672\">Joe Chill<\/a> to orchestrate the \"mugging\" that would result in their deaths.

During this time Batman would regularly team up with other heroes to fight evil (these adventures were published in <a href=\"\/worlds-finest-comics\/4050-18006\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18006\">World\u2019s Finest Comics<\/a> from the 1950's through the 1980's), and many of the team-ups featured Batman, <a href=\"..\/..\/superman\/29-1807\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman<\/a> and, occasionally, <a href=\"\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Robin<\/a> and led to the formation of the <a href=\"..\/..\/justice-league-of-america\/65-31815\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice League of America<\/a>.<\/p><p>After <a href=\"..\/..\/nightwing\/29-1691\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robin<\/a> (Dick Grayson) sustained an injury, Batman insisted on going without a field partner. Dick left to attend college and moved out of Wayne Manor. Batman primarily worked solo, but occasionally he would team up with <a href=\"\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Robin<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/batgirl\/29-1701\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batgirl<\/a>. It was during this period where Batman started becoming a bit darker; this was partly due to the loss of Robin's presence, but mainly because times were changing in the real world. Violent crimes increased in <a href=\"\/gotham-city\/4020-23611\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham<\/a>, and the <a href=\"..\/..\/joker\/29-1702\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joker<\/a> returned with a darker, more sadistic nature; this was shown in the fact that he was again commencing to kill his victims, as he had been doing when first introduced.<\/p><p>The Batman also comes face to face with <a href=\"..\/..\/ras-al-ghul\/29-40816\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ra's al Ghul<\/a>, the Demon's Head. Ra's has lived for over 600 years and is one of the few people who deduces that Bruce Wayne is Batman. Ra's saw their ideas as being the same, but the two became rivals quickly when Batman realized that Ra's did not value the lives of others as he did. During this time Bruce's older brother, Thomas Wayne, Jr., reappears. Thomas becomes an assassin, but his body was taken over by the anti-hero <a href=\"..\/..\/deadman\/29-5690\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deadman<\/a>. Batman was able to remove <a href=\"..\/..\/deadman\/29-5690\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deadman<\/a> from his brother's body, but Thomas soon dies trying to save his younger brother's life. Batman later quit the <a href=\"..\/..\/justice-league-of-america\/65-31815\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice League<\/a> to form his new group called the <a href=\"..\/..\/outsiders\/65-5704\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outsiders<\/a>.

DC Comics attempted to reboot many major characters' origins including Batman. The re-tooled history was recounted in <a href=\"..\/..\/frank-miller\/26-7082\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frank Miller<\/a>\u2019s run on the <a href=\"..\/..\/batman-year-one\/39-42224\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: Year One<\/a> story arc, or, at least the more serious, less campy sides of The Dark Knight. This made Batman darker and more believable and showed how much Batman dominates Bruce Wayne's psychology, so much so that Bruce has fully transformed into the Dark Knight, both physically and mentally. The character of <a href=\"\/james-gordon\/4005-3727\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">Jim Gordon<\/a> was portrayed in greater detail, and the corruption of the <a href=\"..\/..\/gotham-city-police-department\/65-42090\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gotham City Police Department<\/a> was more pronounced, giving more of a reason for <a href=\"..\/..\/gotham-city\/34-23611\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gotham City<\/a> to need Batman. <a href=\"..\/..\/dick-grayson\/29-1691\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dick<\/a>'s backstory remains the same, but <a href=\"..\/..\/jason-todd\/29-6849\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jason Todd<\/a>'s origin was changed, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile. Philip Wayne and Thomas, Jr. were removed from continuity (up until the New 52 Relaunch where different versions of both characters returned) and Bruce was raised by his father's trusted friend and butler, <a href=\"..\/..\/alfred\/29-5556\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alfred Pennyworth<\/a>.<\/p><p>In addition, Batman was no longer a founding member of the Justice League. During the <a href=\"..\/..\/batman-son-of-the-demon\/49-26065\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Son of the Demon<\/a> story arc, Batman marries <a href=\"..\/..\/talia\/29-4917\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talia<\/a>, and she becomes pregnant with their child. When Talia was attacked, Batman nearly dies trying to save her. Talia concludes that she was a hindrance to Batman and pretends to have a miscarriage. The two annulled their marriage, but Talia delivered the baby and gave him up.<\/p><p>Dick Grayson retires the Robin mantle to become Nightwing, and Batman replaces him with orphan Jason Todd to become the new Robin, but he ends up getting killed by the Joker. After losing Jason, Batman becomes self-destructive until Tim Drake enters his life and convinces him to make him the new Robin.<\/p><p>The 1994 company-wide crossover Zero Hour changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing Joe Chill from the new continuity, rendering stories such as \"Year Two\" non-canon.<\/p><p>Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled JLA. Also under Morrison, its revealed that Batman had a child with Talia Al Ghul known as Damian, who was raised to be a ruthless assassin by the age of three.<\/p><p>During the events of Final Crisis, Batman is apparently killed by Darkseid, and he is replaced by Dick Grayson as Batman who enlists Damian as Robin. It eventually revealed that Batman is alive and after his return, he forms Batman Incorporated, where he attempts to use the Batman mantle as an international force for good.<\/p><h3>The New 52<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4293279-batman+91.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4293279\" data-ratio=\"1.5164556962025\" data-width=\"395\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 395px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4293279-batman+91.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4293279\"><img alt=\"Batman's New 52 re-design\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293279-batman+91.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4293279-batman+91.jpg 395w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293279-batman+91.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman's New 52 re-design\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293279-batman+91.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4293279-batman+91.jpg 395w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293279-batman+91.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman's New 52 re-design<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>With the New 52 relaunch, Batman retained a large part of his mythos but there were some changes.

Catwoman no longer knows his secret identity, Grayson is back to being Nightwing, Tim Drake is now Red Robin and leader of the teen titans, Barbara Gordon is now Batgirl and Damian now operates as Bruce's sidekick. He is also a founding member of the Justice League and acts as the team's leader. He first appeared during the event known as Zero Year when Gotham was taken over by the Riddler.<\/p><p>Years later he fought the Court of Owls, a group of criminals who have been controlling Gotham from behind the scenes for many years, and new character Harper Row is introduced as an ally. Also, a violent encounter with the now faceless Joker strained the relationship between the Batman Family. To make matters worse, Damian is later killed by the Heretic during Batman's war with Talia Al Ghul's terrorist organization Leviathan. Batman is consumed by depression and continues to alienate himself from his allies until he discovers a mystical shard that gave him the ability in the story to bring Damian back.<\/p><p>During the events of the weekly series called Batman Eternal, Gordon is framed or murder and Gotham plunge into chaos. Batman's home is turned into an Asylum after the destruction of Arkham, and Bruce loses all of his money after the criminal known as Hush takes over Batman's weapon bases and blows them up, killing many people. Batman is forced to rely on limited resources and ends up living in a penthouse, once belonging to the Court of Owls, in the middle of Gotham.<\/p><p>During Endgame, the Joker reveals he knows Batman's secret identity and orchestrates a plot that sees turn the citizens of Gotham into Joker-ized psychos. In that story, the Joker almost convinces Batman that he is immortal, but it is later revealed that the Joker discovered a substance that allowed him to heal wounds. In their final battle under the bedrocks of Gotham near a pool of dinoseum, the entire cave collapses, and both men apparently die. Months later, Jim Gordon becomes the new Batman and dons a robotic suit, operating within the law. But it is revealed that Bruce is alive but has lost all memory of his days as Batman, and is currently living a rather peaceful life with Julie Madison.<\/p><h3>DC Rebirth<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5436234\" data-ratio=\"1.7215081405313\" data-width=\"1167\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1167px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:172.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5436234\"><img alt=\"Batman's Rebirth re-design\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px\" data-width=\"371\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest 1167w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest 1115w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest 557w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest 371w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman's Rebirth re-design\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest 1167w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest 1115w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest 557w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11128\/111283887\/5436234-9421608823-latest 371w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px\" data-width=\"371\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman's Rebirth re-design<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The launch of DC Rebirth intends to reestablish the universe as it was prior to the events of Flashpoint while incorporating elements from the New 52.

While Batman was tracking down the killer, the Joker himself appears on live TV, on a news report on Arkham Asylum, killing the reporter with his mysterious laughing venom and predicting the deaths of some of the richest individuals in Gotham. Bruce wonders whether the Joker is a deformed version of the Red Hood, a criminal who fell into chemical waste while being engaged by Batman. The Joker carries out his hits as promised, using his venom, despite Batman's efforts to stop him. The city is thrown into chaos when he invades a prison facility and sets its inmates free, providing them with weapons and killing all of its guard personnel in the process. The criminals wreak great havoc throughout the city but are apprehended by Batman. Joker's next target is Bruce Wayne. Thus, Wayne Manor is under strict surveillance and guard by the police, making Bruce unable to act as Batman. He secretly injects himself with some Joker venom he had gathered. The venom takes instant effect and Bruce is rushed to the hospital. But on the way, Alfred administers him with the antidote he had made after careful study and as Bruce recovers, he understands the Joker's true plan. He had gained an understanding of what drives the Joker while under the effects of the venom and realized Bruce Wayne's assassination is only a diversion from his real mission, which is killing everyone in Gotham by poisoning its water reservoir, which Batman deduces from the clues he had gained in the last few days while tracking the Joker. He finds and stops Joker at the reservoir and refrains from killing him, though not without giving him a severe beating. The Joker is put in the reopened Arkham Asylum.<\/p><h3>The Long Halloween<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4162090\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.74831460674157\" data-width=\"890\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 890px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4162090\"><img alt=\"Batman, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 890w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 890w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162090-long_halloween_rooftop.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In Batman's early years, his main objective was to take down Gotham's biggest crime lord Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone. To do this, Batman required the help of two of Gotham's finest, \"hero cop\" Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. Despite dealing massive blows to the criminal empire, the Roman still stood tall until a killer by the name of Holiday started making his move and killing a member of the Falcone Crime family on every occasion.<\/p><p>Over the course of the story, the trio's morals are put into question, notably Dent's, who has let it be known that he does not care for the deaths of criminals and even contemplated stealing some of the weakened Roman's money. Jealous by the attention Holiday has received, the Joker attempts to release his gas on Gotham Square on New Year's Eve to kill everyone in attendance, and hopefully Holiday but he is stopped by Batman.<\/p><p>Later on, it is revealed that Dent was in possession of the same type of gun that was used in the Holiday murders, turning him into a prime suspect. Despite Gordon's suspicions, Batman refuses to believe that his friend, who shares his love for justice, would be a killer. On th Roman's birthday, Sal Maroni, Falcone's rival, is set to testify against Carmine, prosecuted by Dent. Just as things seemed to go Dent's way, Maroni ends up throwing acid in the attorney's face, physically and mentally scarring him. After being rushed to the hospital, Harvey escapes in a crazed state and kills a doctor. Gordon moves Maroni to a new cell, suspecting that he may be Holiday's next target.<\/p><p>Surely enough, Holiday makes his move and kills Maroni and just as he is about to kill Gordon, who was escorting the gangster, Batman appears just in time to save his friend and take down the killer, and he is revealed to be Falcone's son, Alberto, who holds a grudge against his father for neglecting him and keeping him out of the family business. A while later, Dent makes his return, with half his face disfigured, now calling himself Two-Face. He regroups all the costume freaks including Joker, Scarecrow and Poison Ivy, among others and bursts into the disgraced Roman's penthouse to signify the change that has come to Gotham. Batman appears and takes down the villains with the exception of Dent who holds Falcone hostage. Despite Batman's pleads, Two-Face ends up killing Falcone and then surrenders himself. In the end, when confronted by Batman and Gordon, Dent claims that his methods were the most effective in taking down Falcone. Despite witnessing the corruption of their friend, Batman and Gordon's resolve remains strong and they both vow to never give up on ridding Gotham of evil.<\/p><h3>Dark Victory and Robin<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4162088\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5886666666667\" data-width=\"1500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:158.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4162088\"><img alt=\"Batman &amp; Robin - The Dynamic Duo\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman &amp; Robin - The Dynamic Duo\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162088-batman_dark_victory_textless.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman &amp; Robin - The Dynamic Duo<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In the aftermath of the Roman's death, Falcone's daughter, Sofia Gigante has taken over the family business and vows to kill Two-Face who managed to escape from Arkham Asylum. Meanwhile, a killer by the name of Hangman has been killing various cops and implying that Two-Face is responsible. A gang war erupts between the crime families and the costumed freaks, recruited by Two-Face, and in the crossfire, circus acrobats, the Flying Graysons are killed by Falcone associate, Tony Zucco, leaving the performers' son, Dick, an orphan. Feeling sympathy for the child and remembering his own trauma, Bruce Wayne adopts Dick as his son. However, since Bruce was too busy trying to stop the war as Batman, Dick would often sneak out at night looking for his parent's killer. A terrified Tony Zucco, who knows that Batman is looking for him, is confronted by Dick and due to his poor health, ends up dying of a heart attack. Realizing the boy's vigilante tendencies, Bruce reveals his identity and decides to train him in order to avoid his death. It is later revealed that Hangman is actually Sofia Gigante and sets Gotham on fire to bring Dent out of hiding but before she could kill him, Batman saves him, giving Dent the opportunity to kill her and escape into the sewers with the rest of the super-villains with Batman in pursuit. In the climactic battle, Two-Face and his villainous group find themselves in the bat-cave but Dick's presence prevented them from discovering Batman's secret. Batman and Dick end up fighting off and defeating the villains once and for all. In the end, Batman offers Dick a chance to live a normal life away from vigilantism, but Dick insists on joining his war, and so, he becomes Robin, assisting Batman in his mission, and thus the Dynamic Duo was born.<\/p><h3>Tales of the Ghul<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4162092\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4162092-smooch.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.4853228962818\" data-width=\"511\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 511px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4162092-smooch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4162092\"><img alt=\"Batman passes Ra's Al Ghul's test\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" data-width=\"430\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162092-smooch.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4162092-smooch.png 511w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162092-smooch.jpg 430w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman passes Ra's Al Ghul's test\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162092-smooch.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4162092-smooch.png 511w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4162092-smooch.jpg 430w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" data-width=\"430\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman passes Ra's Al Ghul's test<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>While trying to stop the criminal Doctor Darrk, who was leading the League of Assassins at the time, Batman meets the enigmatic Talia Al Ghul, who was kidnapped by Darrk in an attempt to blackmail her father, the wealthy Ra's Al Ghul.

One night, Batman discovers that Robin has been kidnapped and then, Ra's Al Ghul, who has used his immense resources to discover Batman's secret identity, appears to him in the Bat-Cave to ask for his help, as his daughter has also been kidnapped, possibly by the same person who kidnapped Robin. The two work together and, accompanied by Ra's' faithful bodyguard Ubu, travel the world looking for the kidnapper. Batman solves various puzzles and obstacles thrown in his path, and after finding both Talia and Robin, he deduces that Ra's was behind the entire ordeal as a personal test, which Ra's declares he has passed. Ra's reveals that he wants to change the world into a better place, but to that, he wants to eradicate most of mankind. However, he is growing old and reveals that this machination took place because he was in need of a successor, and Batman has proven himself worthy of that position as well as the affections of his only daughter, Talia.

Worried for Dick's safety, Batman decides to keep it that way and retires the Robin mantle, but Dick's insists that he will remain a crime-fighter and he would, later on, become the super-hero known as Nightwing. On the anniversary of his parents' death, Batman, as is his tradition, keeps watching over Crime Alley, the site of that tragic night. However, on his way back to the Batmobile, he finds a young street orphan by the name of Jason Todd attempting to steal the tires of the car. Though impressed by the kid's courage, he decides to take him to a school for the homeless, but when it is revealed that the school housed criminals, Batman, with Jason's help, takes it down. With nowhere for Jason to go and at the risk of him becoming another criminal on the streets, Batman decides to take Jason in as his own son, and seeing his potential to be a hero and also partly due to the loneliness he experienced after Dick Grayson's departure, offers Jason the mantle of Robin, which Jason gladly accepts. Batman later discovers that Jason's mother died of an overdose and his father was a reluctant partner of Two-Face, who ended up getting killed by the criminal. Although Batman attempted to hide this from Robin, fearing what he may do, his faith in Jason is restored when Robin, having discovered Two-Face's acts, spared him even though he had the chance avenge his father's death. This made Batman see Jason as a worthy sidekick.<\/p><h3>A Death in the Family<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4162106\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4162106-the_death_of_jason_todd.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.484\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4162106-the_death_of_jason_todd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4162106\"><img alt=\"Death of Robin\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4162106-the_death_of_jason_todd.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4162106-the_death_of_jason_todd.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Death of Robin\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4162106-the_death_of_jason_todd.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4162106-the_death_of_jason_todd.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Death of Robin<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As time passed, it quickly became evident to Batman that Jason was far from the ideal crime-fighter. His conduct on the field was in stark contrast to that of Batman's cold professionalism. Jason would often thrust himself into exceedingly dangerous situations, endangering both student and mentor, giving vent to his inner emotions, which seemed to be dominated by rage. This became even more evident when Jason seemingly killed a serial rapist who had walked free after causing the death of one of his victims. Batman soon realized Robin hadn't coped with the death of his parents and felt it was best to make him inactive.<\/p><p>Back at his birthplace in Crime Alley, Jason finds his birth certificate and learns that his mother wasn't the late Catherine Todd, but that there are three women who could be his mother, and all there are out of the country, so he left off in search of the first one, in the Middle East where he coincidentally meets up with Batman who was there tracking down the Joker. Together, they thwart the Joker's plans and take down the terrorists, but to Jason's dismay, the suspected woman is not his mother.<\/p><p>Continuing their investigation, and after an encounter with the deadly assassin Lady Shiva, they eventually track down Sheila Haywood, who was working in famine relief efforts in Ethiopia and it is revealed that she is, in fact, Jason's real mother. Bruce leaves Jason to spend time with his mother while he chases after the Joker, but it is later revealed that Sheila was being blackmailed by the Joker into giving him shipments of medical supplies that he can sell in the black market while transferring his deadly Joker gas to relief destinations. Batman orders Jason to stay put while he chases the Joker, but Jason defies Batman's orders and leaves for the warehouse to find his mother. Jason manages to find her and reveals his secret identity to her, but she turns him over to the Joker in an attempt to save her own life. Joker savagely beats Jason with a crowbar, then detonates an explosive that kills both Jason and his mother.<\/p><p>Batman arrives just as the explosion goes off, and as he searches through the rubble, he finds, to his horror, the lifeless corpse of Jason. Batman grieves over the horrible site and vows to avenge Jason's death and take down the Joker once and for all. Batman vengefully tracks down the Joker, and though he manages to stop his latest death plot, the madman escapes, ending this counter the same way as others, unresolved. Batman continues grieving over Jason's death, considering it to be his greatest failure and vows to never endanger anyone else in this line of work. Since then, he keeps Jason's costume in a glass casing in the Bat-Cave as a memorial, underneath it reads \"A Good Soldier\".<\/p><h3>A Lonely Place of Dying<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4165338\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165338-tim32.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.4990619136961\" data-width=\"533\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 533px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165338-tim32.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4165338\"><img alt=\"Tim Drake the new Robin\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165338-tim32.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165338-tim32.jpg 533w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165338-tim32.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tim Drake the new Robin\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165338-tim32.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165338-tim32.jpg 533w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165338-tim32.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Tim Drake the new Robin<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After Jason's tragic death, Batman became more violent and almost self-destructing when he battled crime. Tim Drake, a young boy who witnessed the death of the Graysons, noticed the dark nature of the Batman after the loss of Robin. Tim once idolized the Flying Graysons and was in attendance when Dick's parents were killed. He also idolized Batman and Robin, as he saw them as heroes. Tim was able to deduce that Dick Grayson was, in fact, Robin when he noticed the costumed fighter perform an acrobatic move that only Dick could do, and knowing that the former acrobat was adopted by Bruce Wayne, he pieced things together and deduced that the millionaire is indeed Batman. He had figured out that the original Robin was Dick Grayson and thus, Bruce Wayne had to be Batman. Tim knew that Batman needed an ally in his war and after being unsuccessful in convincing Dick to return to the role, Dick petitions Bruce to train Tim to become the next Robin, in order to keep Batman sane, but Batman refuses, vowing to never endanger anyone but himself in his war on crime. Meanwhile, Two-Face is on the loose and has prepared a plot to kill Batman once and for all, and this would have happened if not for the timely intervention of Tim Drake, wearing the Robin costume with Alfred's blessing and providing the necessary distraction for Batman to defeat his foe. In the end, both Alfred and Nightwing insist that the boy is capable of doing much good, especially under the guidance of Batman, and after much reluctance, Batman ends up agreeing. After a gruelling training regime, Tim finally becomes the new Robin.<\/p><h3>Knightfall<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4165396\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.67666666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4165396\"><img alt=\"Batman meets Bane\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman meets Bane\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165396-bane_batbreaker_h4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman meets Bane<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After a long time of hard work, Batman and Robin finally succeed in placing all of the worst villains in Arkham Asylum and thus apparently ensuring peace for Gotham. At one point he also encounters Jean-Paul Valley who is called Azrael, a victim of \"The System\" who was brainwashed into becoming an assassin for the sinister order known as The Order of Dumas, but Batman comforts Valley and takes him in as an ally to fight crime alongside him and reject his previous life. Just when it seemed that Gotham was at peace, a new villain makes his way to Gotham seeking to conquer it and defeat its guardian, the Batman. The villain, known only as Bane, destroys the walls of Arkham and frees every single inmate to rage havoc on the city. Batman, who was also sick at the time, is forced to run a gauntlet of his worst enemies, putting both his body and mind to the test. After a series of plots and encounters that weigh heavily on him, mentally and physically, fighting the likes of the Mad Hatter, the Ventriloquist, Amygdala, Victor Zsasz, Firefly, Riddler, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, Joker and Two-Face, as well as encountering Bane's henchmen Zombie, Trogg and Bird, Batman finally manages to put them all back in prison however still oblivious to the mastermind behind this Gauntlet.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4165427\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5066666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4165427\"><img alt=\"Broken by Bane\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.png 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Broken by Bane\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165427-bane_breaks_batman.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Broken by Bane<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Batman finally returns home to rest only to be confronted by Bane, whose plan has come full circle and has come to Gotham to conquer it and defeat its protector. Though having almost no strength left, Batman accepts Bane's challenge and has one final fight. However, he is no match for this skilled foe, whose strength has also increased due to a drug known as Venom, and despite his best efforts Batman is horribly beaten and has his back broken by Bane in his own Batcave, paralyzing him. Bane throws Batman's body in the middle of a crowded street so that everyone sees the fall of the Dark Knight. Before his identity is compromised, Alfred and Robin quickly take him back to the manor to nurse him back to health. However, his will is just as broken as his body, as he realizes that he cannot don the costume again, and since Gotham needs a protector, he entrusts the mantle of Batman to Jean-Paul Valley and instructs a distraught Robin to be his ally.<\/p><h3>Knightquest and Knightsend<\/h3><p>After his paralysis, Batman is tended to by Shondra Kinsolving, a doctor whom Bruce met before and the two shared romantic feelings. However, one night, Shondra is kidnapped along with one of her patients, Jack Drake, Robin's father, and so, despite being in a wheelchair, Bruce, along with Alfred go after the kidnappers, and track them down to London, leaving Gotham under the care of Robin (who is oblivious to his father's kidnapping) and the new Batman. It is revealed in the story that Shondra had psychic powers, and was kidnapped by her brother Asp who intended to use those powers for his own gain. Bruce is caught in a telepathic exchange between Shondra and Asp, and the energy released causes Bruce to regain mobility of his legs. Now healed, he defeats Asp and saves Drake and Shondra, but the doctor's mental state was regressed to childhood due to the drugs given to her by her brother and she loses all memory of her relationship with Bruce. Preparing to get back into shape and regain his strength, Batman seeks the help of the skilled martial artist and assassin, Lady Shivam who agrees with the condition that he must kill. After several weeks of intense training, when it was time for Batman to kill, he refuses, causing Shiva to send variously skilled assassins after him to force his hand. Bruce defeats the assassins and appears to kill the final one, much to Shiva's delight. However, he had used a technique that appeared to be lethal even though it was not. With his strength now regained, Batman is ready to come back to Gotham.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4165408\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.4406666666667\" data-width=\"1500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4165408\"><img alt=\"Batman vs Batman\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 666w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman vs Batman\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 666w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165408-bm_knfl-v3-cv.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman vs Batman<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Meanwhile, back in Gotham, Valley, now operating as Batman, attempts to track down Bane, who has now taken control of Gotham's underworld. However, Valley's brainwashing by the Order resurfaces, causing him to become more violent and to start losing control over his sanity. Donning a new tech-heavy costume and refusing Robin as a partner, Valley becomes a far darker and much more violent Batman and eventually manages to defeat Bane and end his reign of terror. As the new Batman watches over Gotham, his vicious and reckless methods became intolerable by Robin, especially when he caused the deaths of the villain the Abattoir and his victims. When Robin tried to reason with him, Valley lashed out at him, almost killing him as he now considers himself to be superior to the real Batman. When Batman returns, having healed from his back injury, Jean-Paul tried to kill him to prove his superiority but Batman defeats and tricks him into removing his costume, thereby getting rid of \"the system\" in his head. Humbled and regretting his actions, Valley admits to Bruce that he (Bruce) is the one and only Batman and vows to redeem himself in his eyes. Though having regained the use of his legs, Batman decides to travel the world to fully regain his strength, and in his absence gives the mantle to the man he should have given it to in the first place, Nightwing until he comes back.<\/p><h3>No Man's Land<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4165474\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4165474\"><img alt=\"Batman watches his city in ruins\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman watches his city in ruins\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165474-batman-no-mans-land-1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman watches his city in ruins<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Gotham is struck by a massive Earthquake, one which claims the lives of many people in Gotham.

Bruce and Alfred barely survive the earthquake, and once out of the rubble, Batman watches in horror his city in ruins and there's nothing he could do about it. With most of the city destroyed, criminals run rampant around the remains and chaos ensues to the point where Gotham is declared a No Man's Land by the government and it is cut off from the rest of the country. Batman travels to Washington, and as Bruce Wayne does his best to convince Congress to help the city he loves, but he fails to do so, causing him to be distraught and almost loses all hope himself in exile until he is motivated back into action by Talia Al Ghul.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4165588\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.55\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4165588\"><img alt=\"Batman marks his territory in NML\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg 619w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman marks his territory in NML\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg 619w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4165588-batman_no_mans_land_gallery_24.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman marks his territory in NML<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Meanwhile in Gotham, with very limited food and resources, new rules are applied and the criminals divide the city into territories and use spray paint to claim ownership of said territories.

After training her, he hands her a costume and she officially becomes the fourth Robin. Though initially there were some problems, especially when she used lethal force on the villain Mr. Zsasz, she starts proving herself when she handily takes down Tiger Moth. Stephanie's infectious energy and enthusiasm grow on Batman and he starts to see her as a worthy partner. However, while tracking down the assassin Scarab, she disobeys Batman's order to stay put and ends up getting herself held hostage and almost compromising the mission. Because of that, Batman ends her tenure as Robin. Determined to win back Batman's trust, Stephanie steals from the Bat-cave one of his contingency plans that was supposed to take place in case of crime in Gotham got too out of control. The plan, which she put into motion behind Batman's back, dealt with unifying all the Gotham crime-families under one man, Matches Malone. What Stephanie didn't know was that Malone is actually one of Batman's underground alter-egos, and because Malone was not present at the staged meeting between crime-lords, things went awry and a huge gang war raged in Gotham, causing the deaths of many. Batman's reputation takes a major hit when he is seen by the media in broad day light holding the dead body of a young student who was killed in the crossfire of the gang war, and even more so when makes several morally questionable actions, including forcefully taking over command of the GCPD (which the results in the death of many), and attempting to put his underground ally, Orpheus, as the leader of all the gangs, but the Black Mask makes his move, kills Orpheus and becomes Gotham's kingpin of crime instead. Another consequence of this war was Stephanie Brown's death after intense torture at the hands of Black Mask. Batman was at her side in her last moments and comforted her with the fact that she did earn her place as Robin.<\/p><h3>Under the Red Hood<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-272033\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5075\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-272033\"><img alt=\"Batman vs Red Hood\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8190\/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8190\/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman vs Red Hood\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8190\/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8190\/272033-159917-jason-todd.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman vs Red Hood<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After the recent war, Batman has lost too much. Robin, Batgirl and Oracle have left Gotham City, Stephanie Brown is dead, Nightwing is injured, the GCPD sees Batman as a criminal and the Black Mask controls all crime in Gotham. However, a mysterious figure known as The Red Hood has been making his move on Black Mask's operations and taking control of his gangs. While intercepting one of Black Mask's shipments, Batman and Nightwing encounter Red Hood for the first time, and as they chase after him, they encounter the cyborg Amazo, which they barely manage to defeat. The Red Hood then steals another one of Mask's shipments tries to blackmail him, but the meeting turns sour with Freeze and Batman and Nightwing getting involved, and all the villains end up escaping. However, during the battle, Batman is intrigued by Red Hood's skills, as he sees something familiar.<\/p><p>While intercepting another one of Black Mask's operations, Red Hood is confronted by Batman where they fight to a stalemate. Red Hood finally takes off his mask and to Batman's horror, reveals that he is in fact, Jason Todd, the Robin who apparently died many years ago and even gives him samples of his DNA to prove it before escaping. It is revealed in the story that Jason came back after he was dipped in a Lazarus Pit by Talia Al Ghul. After this revelation, Alfred offers to remove Jason's memorial from the Cave, but Batman refuses, claiming that the recent developments don't change anything.<\/p><p>After Red Hood blows up Black Mask's penthouse, the desperate crime lord seeks the help of Deathstroke of the Secret Society, who sends Hyena, Captain Nazi and Count Vertigo to kill the Red Hood. Batman intervenes and together they manage to take down the trio of super-villains, but not without Red Hood killing one of them and escaping.<\/p><p>After tricking Black Mask into killing the last of his lieutenants, Red Hood, who has been holding the Joker captive, challenges Batman to come to Crime Alley to end things once and for all. After apprehending Black Mask, Batman complies and meets up with Jason. After an intense back and forth fight, Batman defeats Jason and apologizes for failing him. Disgusted, Jason reveals that the reason he holds a grudge against Batman is that he never killed Joker to avenge his death. He then holds Joker hostage and throws Bruce a gun, and challenges him to make a choice: either kill Joker or kill him. Batman refuses both choices and ends up incapacitating Jason with a Batarang. An ecstatic Joker ends up blowing the entire place and in the aftermath, Jason manages to escape.<\/p><h3>Infinite Crisis<\/h3><p>Bruce also becomes more suspicious of other heroes, creating a super satellite called <a href=\"..\/..\/brother-eye\/29-51483\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brother Eye<\/a>, which is stolen and eventually causes the death of <a href=\"..\/..\/ted-kord\/29-2054\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ted Kord<\/a>.

The auction is then attacked by a horde of League of Assassins Man-Bats and despite fighting off a large number of them, he is eventually captured and brought before his former lover Talia Al Ghul. She reveals that they have a son together named <a href=\"..\/..\/damian-wayne\/29-42413\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Damian<\/a>, who was raised in the ways of the League. Talia leaves Damian under Bruce's care, and the boy proves to be very troublesome and very hard to control. Damian takes an instant disliking to Tim Drake, as he considered him to be an impostor and that the Robin mantle is his right. In an attempt to prove himself to his father, he goes so far as to murder the villain known as The Spook, and brutally attacks and almost kills Robin. Batman starts to teach Damian respect and discipline and agrees to keep him by his side as long as he conducts himself properly and refrains from killing. Damian agrees and together they travel to Gibraltar where they attempt to stop Talia from executing a terrorist attack. However, Talia reveals that her plan was to get Batman acquainted with his son and they can all be united together as a family.

Batman plays a key role in the relaunch, and one of the biggest changes in the universe is Bruce Wayne's return as Batman and <a href=\"..\/..\/dick-grayson\/29-1691\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dick Grayson<\/a>'s return as Nightwing.<\/p><p>Part of the New 52 relaunch involved a condensed timeline of the DC universe, which slightly affected Batman's origin story. However, unlike most characters, Batman has retained a certain amount of his Post-Crisis history, while some have been retold.<\/p><h3>Early Life<\/h3><p>Like his Post-Crisis counterpart, Bruce was born into the prestigious and wealthy Wayne family to a surgeon and philanthropist Thomas Wayne, and social worker Martha Wayne of the Kane Family. When he was very young, Martha was expecting a second child, but after a mysterious car accident, was forced into premature labour and the baby died. After that, the family went on a vacation to forget that traumatic event, but the family butler, Jarvis Pennyworth was mysteriously killed, and his son, Alfred, a former actor and military medic, took his father's place as the butler, a position he continued to hold in Bruce's adult life. As a child, Bruce felt under pressure because of his family's reputation, and so he had a habit of sneaking out into the city and explore, to feel what it's like to be just like everyone else.<\/p><p>One night, Bruce and his parents went to the movies to watch <em>The Mark of Zorro<\/em>, and on their way back, they were held at gunpoint by a mugger named Joe Chill, who attempted to take Martha's pearl necklace, but, in a state of panic, ended up shooting and killing both Thomas and Martha, leaving young Bruce traumatized by the event.<\/p><p>Bruce was convinced that his parents were the victims of a nefarious conspiracy and made it his goal to find meaning to their deaths and apprehend their killer. After witnessing certain signs, Bruce started digging into the mythical Court of Owls, an old-wives-tale about an underground society that secretly controlled Gotham, whom he thought was responsible for his parents' deaths, but in his search for clues, he had himself trapped in an abandoned warehouse for several days before he was found by Alfred. As he grows older, Bruce would constantly be haunted by this tragedy, often making him awkward among his teachers and classmates, and straining his relationship with his high school girlfriend, Julie Madison. Unable to cope with the pain, he had himself enlisted in Arkham Asylum in order to remove his memories using electro-shock therapy, but he was unable to go through with it and decided to use his pain as fuel. At the age of 18, he once again attempted to find his parents' killer and started weightlifting and training in martial arts. He befriended his schoolmate Erin Mckillen, daughter of Irish Mobsters from the Mckillen Crime Family, and he used this friendship and her connections to track down Joe Chill. However, to his shock, he learns that there was no secret conspiracy, Chill was simply a poor, desperate man who needed money, and killed the Waynes out of panic. Bruce, crushed by this revelation, leaves Chill and decides to travel the world on a journey to train and vowed to fight and end crime in Gotham.<\/p><h3>Travelling Around The World<\/h3><p>At the age of nineteen, Bruce found himself in <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/rio-de-janeiro\/4020-52991\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-52991\">Rio De Janeiro<\/a>, where he met a criminal by the name of Don Miguel who taught Bruce high-speed driving and several insane driving tricks. In their final lesson, however, Bruce was instructed to lose the Policia in a bright red custom-made convertible car and during an intense car chase, Miguel attempted to kill the cops using a dangerous weapon, but Bruce, having learned everything he needed from the criminal and wanting to prevent him from causing any more damage, crashes the car, trapping Miguel before finally knocking him out and leaving him to be apprehended by the authorities.<\/p><p>At the age of twenty-one, in <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/egypt\/4020-55877\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55877\">Egypt<\/a>, Bruce seeks out an old Russian scientist named Sergei to teach him what they call the impossible. Sergei challenges Bruce to a test by trapping him under the Sphinx, where he has limited supplies and oxygen. Bruce spends six months preparing for this test, tinkering with tools and planning for every scenario in order to survive, but Sergei tells him that he needs to go beyond planning and what is called possible in order to survive. Indeed, once Bruce is actually trapped, most of his preparations weren't operational and he was forced to improvise and go beyond what he thought was possible in order to escape and he manages to pass Sergei's test.<\/p><p>At the age of twenty-four, Bruce found himself in the middle of a pit in the Northeast of Harstad, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/norway\/4020-55828\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55828\">Norway<\/a>, fighting for twenty-eight hours straight in a death match, defeating every fighter to challenge him but avoided killing anyone despite the insistence of the Pit Queen. Bruce came to this pit seeking to use his body to wage war, but the Queen claims that he cannot win this war without killing, and he will continue to fight until he dies. However, Bruce persists, winning battle after battle but without killing anyone, and in the end, there were no more fighters to challenge him because they were all afraid of him.<\/p><p>At one point, Bruce travelled to France seeking out famed manhunter Henri Ducard, in order to learn stealth and tracking. Impressed by the fact that Bruce was capable of finding him and son, Morgan, Ducard agreed to take him under his wing. Bruce would learn a lot from Ducard, while also developing a rivalry with Morgan, but when Bruce discovers, that the Ducards were also mercenaries and would kill their targets, Bruce cuts all ties from them. Henri orders Morgan to kill Bruce, an attempt that fails, and a vengeful Bruce beats down Morgan in a fit of rage, almost killing him.<\/p><p>Towards the end of his training, Bruce travels to the Himalayas to train with Shihan Matsuda where he learned swordsmanship, healing and meditation. During his stay, he develops feelings for a young woman named Mio and though he was warned by Shihan to avoid personal ties, those feelings caused Bruce to inadvertently allow an assassin, hired by Matsuda's wife, into the household and attack and gravely injure Mio and the Matsudas. Though Bruce managed to fight him off, Shihan's injuries were fatal and before he died, he warned Bruce to avoid personal relationships or they will have him killed. Bruce took this lesson to heart, as he decides to cut himself off from everyone, and so, after four years of travels, Bruce returns to Gotham.<\/p><h3>Return to Gotham<\/h3><p>Back in Gotham, with nothing but his war on crime on his mind, and no regard for his legacy as a Wayne, Bruce sets up a secret headquarters in an old brownstone in Park Row where he is joined by his faithful butler Alfred, who disapproves of this whole endeavour. One of his first missions deals with taking down The Red Hood Gang, a group of criminals who endorse random violence. However, he has been having a hard time winning his war due to his inexperience, carelessness and uncontrolled anger. In Bruce's absence from Gotham, his Uncle, Philipe Kane, who had declared Bruce legally dead while keeping tabs on him, has taken control of Wayne Enterprises and is using it to produce weapons. In an attempt to improve the company's public image, Philip attempts to convince Bruce to take control of his family's company, but Bruce refuses, as has no interest in living as \"Bruce Wayne\".<\/p><p>To make matters worse, the Red Hood gang is stealing the weapons produced by the company to further terrorize the city. Phil's leading strategist, Edward Nygma, advises Phil to kill Bruce in order to solve their problems but Philip refuses and still tries to convince Bruce to lead the company.<\/p><p>However, following a surprise party for Bruce by his uncle, the Red Hood Gang, thanks to a tip from Nygma, ambush Bruce and give him a vicious beating. Bruce barely survives and manages to makes it back to the manor where he is nursed back to health by Alfred. Enraged by Nygma's actions, Philip attempts to kill the villain, admitting that Bruce is a better man than both of them, but Nygma incapacitates Philip and ends their alliance.<\/p><p>Bruce comes to terms with the fact that he is losing this war and asks his father for guidance. Then a bat crashes through his window, and Bruce finally decides that he will become a Bat.<\/p><h3>Becoming Batman<\/h3><p>Finally realizing his purpose, Bruce and Alfred set up their base in a cave under Wayne Manor, and Bruce sets off to strike fear into the hearts of criminals as Batman. He starts by methodically taking out members of the Red Hood gang, quickly establishing his reputation and finally getting the attention of Red Hood One, the gang's leader. While investigating the gang's operations, eventually, with some help from a guilt-ridden Phillip, who was forced into becoming a member of the gang, Bruce discovers that the Red Hood gang are planning to use dangerous toxins from the Ace Chemical factory to terrorize the city. He holds a press conference in front of the factory and exposes the gang's plans, forcing them to invade the factory right away. As Batman, Bruce fights off the Red Hood gang, but not without the death of Uncle Philip, who was killed by the leader for attempting to stop him. As the GCPD round up members of the gang, the factory burns down and Batman goes after the leader, preventing him from escaping and defeating him, but despite Bruce's efforts to save him, the Red Hood allows himself to fall into a large acid container.<\/p><p>In the aftermath, Batman continues setting up his Bat-Cave and establishing himself as a hero in Gotham. Edward Nygma, now calling himself The Riddler, makes his presence known and knocks out all power from the city, in an attempt to challenge the people to get smarter.<\/p><h3>The Zero Year<\/h3><p>Following Riddler's blackout, a huge storm hits and the city plunges into chaos. To make matters worse, Batman, now declared a fugitive by Commissioner Loeb, investigate a series of gruesome murders committed by a disgruntled WaynTech employee, Dr. Helfern, who had injected himself with a dangerous formula, turning himself into the terrifying Dr. Death. As Bruce continues his investigation, he seeks the help of Lucius Fox, an old friend of his father's an engineer who used to work for WayneTech. However, both are attacked and almost killed by Dr. Death had it not for the timely intervention of Officer Jim Gordon. Realizing that Dr. Death is more than he can handle on his own, Batman begrudgingly teams with Gordon, as Bruce had once thought to have witnessed Jim receive a bribe (though that was not the case) years ago and he sees him as nothing more than a corrupt cop. They split up and discover that Helfern is Riddler's pawn as part of Riddler's plan to take over the city's power grid. Despite both men's valiant efforts, including a violent face-off between Batman and Dr. Death over Gotham Harbor, Riddler's plan works, as the power returns to the city, but under Riddler's control.<\/p><p>In the following months, known as The Zero Year, the city's vegetation overgrows, and it falls into ruin, turning it into a \"Savage City\", with Riddler operating as the City's ruler, challenging the people to best him in a riddle in order to prove their intellectual worth and win back their city. Having recovered from his battle with Helfern, Bruce teams up with Gordon and Lucius Fox in an elaborate plan to determine his location and take him down, where Batman even attempts to take on Riddler's riddle challenge himself. In the end, Batman manages to locate Riddler, but not before the villain arranges an airstrike against the city and challenges Batman to solve his riddles in order to stop it. Though Batman is successful and defeats him, Riddler gives him one final test, which involves sending a current of electricity through a device that sends the signal that calls off the airstrike, but the device is attached to Riddler's heart, so that would kill him. Batman knocks out Riddler and uses the device on himself, thus stopping the air-strike, but stopping his own heart as well had it not for the timely intervention of Alfred, who resuscitated him. With Riddler defeated, thanks to the efforts of Gordon and Fox, the power to the city returns.<\/p><p>In the aftermath, Nygma is placed in Arkham Asylum, Gordon becomes the new Police Commissioner, and Bruce embraces his legacy as a Wayne, and with Lucius Fox, re-builds Wayne Enterprises and restores its good name. Bruce is paid a visit by his old flame, Julie Madison, giving him a chance at a happy life, but, despite Alfred's insistence, Bruce instead chooses to live his life as Gotham's Guardian, The Batman.<\/p><h3>Early Adventures<\/h3><p>As Batman's legend grew, so did his Rogues' Gallery, and in these days, Batman has many adventures with some being loose adaptations of Post-Crisis stories while others being complete retellings. In The Joker's first appearance, not unlike his Pre-New 52 version, he announced plans to kill several key figures and attempted to poison Gotham's Reservoir, which Batman managed to stop. Batman's history with Ra's Al Ghul and his daughter Talia have mostly remained intact, including fighting Ra's in the desert, stopping him from unleashing a deadly virus, and fathering a child with Talia (without his knowing). It was also confirmed that Bane had once made his move on Gotham and even broke Batman's back. In another adventure, the cult leader called Deacon Blackfire had assembled Gotham's poor as his followers and had Batman chained in his dungeon, tortured and drugged for days in an attempt to convert him into one of his followers, an attempt that failed. Batman manages to break free of Blackfire and convince his followers into turning against him, and Blackfire ends up getting killed by his own followers.<\/p><p>In Batman's early days, he formed a partnership with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent, an old classmate of Bruce's whom he had convinced into becoming Gotham's District Attorney. In their combined efforts, they targeted Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone and his Crime Family, which sparked an immense gang war that ended with Falcone retreating to Hong Kong, and The Penguin, a rising crime lord himself, took his place as Gotham's ruler of organized crime. Batman keeps the Penguin in check, waiting for him to slip in order to take him down, but also uses him to gather information about the underworld.<\/p><p>Batman's partnership with Dent put him at odds with Bruce Wayne's old friend Eren Mckillen and her twin sister Sharon, daughters of the Irish Mob, who have followed in their family's footsteps and even attempted to assassinate Jim Gordon. After their capture, the Mckillen Twins are given a life sentence thanks to Dent's efforts, and Sharon ends up committing suicide in order to give her sister, Eren the chance to escape and exact revenge on Dent. She does so by killing Dent's wife, Gilda, and burning half his face with acid before leaving the country. Dent would become Two-Face, one of Batman's most prominent enemies.<\/p><h3>The Court of Owls<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106890\/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2114819\" data-ratio=\"1.5434083601286\" data-width=\"622\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 622px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106890\/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2114819\"><img alt=\"The Court of Owls\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106890\/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106890\/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 622w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/106890\/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106890\/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Court of Owls\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106890\/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106890\/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 622w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/106890\/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106890\/2114819-court_of_owls.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Court of Owls<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After stopping an outbreak in Arkham Asylum with Dick Grayson\u2019s help, Bruce attends a formal gathering in Wayne Manor and announces Wayne Enterprises' new goal of rebuilding certain districts of Gotham City as well as improving the train system. Later on, Batman investigates a crime scene with Harvey Bullock where he discovers a message saying \u201cBruce Wayne will DIE tomorrow\u201d and after returning to the Bat Cave finds out from the analysis of some DNA samples found in the area, that the killer is Dick Grayson.<\/p><p>The following day, while meeting up with Lincoln March, Gotham City\u2019s new mayoral candidate, for a conversation in the Old Wayne Tower, Bruce is attacked by a mysterious assassin who overpowers him and throws him off the window. Bruce struggles with the assassin in mid-air and manages to grab on to a gargoyle while the assassin falls down. He discovers that his attacker is an assassin sent by the Court of Owls known as the Talon, but does not believe it as the Court of Owls is simply an old nursery rhyme.<\/p><p>Batman manages to escape from a trap set by the Court of Owls during his investigation into whether they really exist or not. After returning to the Bat Cave, he tells Dick of how he investigated the existence of the Court sometime after the death of his parents and discovered nothing. Continuing his investigation in the sewers of Gotham City, Batman is suddenly knocked out by the Talon; after waking up, he finds himself trapped in the Court\u2019s labyrinth.<\/p><p>Batman has been missing for days, but Commissioner Gordon refuses to turn the Bat Signal off, using it as a source of hope for their allies and Gotham City. Batman is unable to escape the labyrinth and keeps finding himself returning again and again to the same places and is slowly being driven insane. The Talon then suddenly attacks Batman. Beaten and battered, all hope seems lost for Batman, but he manages to fight back and eventually defeats Talon. He finally escapes the labyrinth through an opening he causes after an explosion and it leads him back to the Bat Cave.<\/p><h3>Night of the Owls<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4293329\" data-ratio=\"0.5\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4293329\"><img alt=\"Batman defends his home against the Talons\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman defends his home against the Talons\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293329-batmanrev4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman defends his home against the Talons<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Soon after escaping the labyrinth, the Court of Owls sends out all of their Talons to attack the public figures of Gotham City in order to take it back. In the Bat Cave, Bruce reveals to Nightwing that the Talon who attacked him is William Cobb, Dick\u2019s great-grandfather, as well as the fact that he was meant to be a Talon as well. Later on, numerous Talons then attack Bruce in his home, and after making his way to the Bat Cave attempts to fight them off using a special armour. While analyzing the data found on a Talon\u2019s gauntlet, Alfred finds a list of assassination targets for the Talons. Alfred calls the rest of the family (Red Robin, Red Hood, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl and the Birds of Prey), asking for their help to save Gotham City.<\/p><p>Batman deduces that the Talons are weakened by cold and has Alfred reduce the cave temperature, giving Batman the chance to finish them off. Batman then goes to Arkham Asylum in order to save Dr. Arkham; Talons attack them both until the inmates are released who then proceed to attack the Talons. He then proceeds to Lincoln March\u2019s location to save him but is too late; he finds a dying March who gives him a message, the names of three members of the Court of Owls.<\/p><p>After scaring off one of the members of the Court in their own house, Batman goes to Harbor House, a building he investigated in search of the Court back when he was a child. He swears to end the Court of Owls once and for all. However, he finds them all dead in the dining room and realizes who was behind this attack and goes to Willowood Home for Children, a hospital for children suffering from mental illnesses and neurological disorders. He finds Lincoln March, who staged what looked to be the Court of Owls suicide.<\/p><p>As he dons a new advanced armor, March reveals that he is Bruce Wayne\u2019s brother that never was, Thomas Wayne Jr. He claims to have been placed in Willowwood, back when it was a premier hospital, after being born early and hurt due to a car accident. After Thomas and Martha Wayne died, Willowwood lost its funding and eventually became a mental hospital for mentally ill, lost and forgotten children.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3049967\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101306\/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5131348511384\" data-width=\"571\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 571px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101306\/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3049967\"><img alt=\"Batman vs March - Art by Andy Clarke &amp; Tomeu Morey\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101306\/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101306\/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg 571w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101306\/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman vs March - Art by Andy Clarke &amp; Tomeu Morey\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101306\/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101306\/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg 571w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101306\/3049967-bm_cv11_var.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman vs March - Art by Andy Clarke &amp; Tomeu Morey<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Batman and Lincoln March fight all over the city and despite being overpowered, Batman manages to plant a small bomb on March\u2019s back to stop him. March survives the explosion and manages to capture Batman once more, this time in a building where he begins to plant explosives. Batman manages to escape just in time as the explosives detonate, leaving March behind as he taunts him, telling him to run away from the truth.<\/p><p>Bruce has returned to Wayne Manor and is slowly healing from his wounds. He tells Commissioner Gordon that he privately searched the wreckage of the destroyed tower but didn't find anything. Dick arrives and Bruce tells him the truth: for one night, Bruce Wayne had a brother. His brother was born premature and with neurological damage and only lived for a single night. He explains his investigation on the matter, stating that the medical records were not faked and his parents would have told him if Thomas Wayne Jr. did survive. He says that the truth is a mystery for now until he finds the evidence that will answer it. Bruce then declares that when the Court of Owls re-emerges, he will always be watching.<\/p><h3>Born to Kill<\/h3><p>Batman is now adopting his own son Damian as Robin, but has trouble coming to terms with his violent upbringing and is trying to overcome his son's nature with proper nurture, and at the same time, Damian thinks his father doesn't trust him and attempts to prove his worth to him.<\/p><p>The villain known as Nobody, who is, in fact, Morgan Ducard, son of one of Bruce's trainers, Henri Ducard, makes his presence known and confronts Bruce over the ineffectiveness of his crime-fighting methods. Nobody prefers to kill his enemies, and since Batman refused to see things his way, vowed to kill Batman and take Robin as his apprentice. After a deadly encounter with Nobody, the tension between Batman and Robin grows, as Damian does not like how Bruce constantly hides things from him, notably his violent past with Ducard. Damian then leaves Wayne Manor to learn under Nobody who takes him on a mission to hunt down a corrupt ambassador in order to prove his new found will to kill. However, Damian reveals that this was a plan to draw out Nobody and allow Batman to track him down. Learning this, Nobody starts to torture Damian and forces Batman to hear the sound over the radio. An enraged Batman eventually tracks down Nobody and defeats him in a savage fight before leaving him for the police. However, realizing that Nobody will return to torment them, Damian kills him much to Bruce's horror.<\/p><p>Back at the manor as Alfred heals their wounds, Bruce, instead of being angry, tells Damian that he understands Damian's struggle of whether or not to kill, but tells him they can't build a better world by repeating a cycle of violence, and he vows that he will never give up on his son.<\/p><p>Shaken by the encounter with Nobody, Damian wants to prove to his father that he is capable of compassion while also proving that he is the best Robin, even challenging his predecessors. After several months, Damian returns to his father with a pearl from Martha Wayne's pearl necklace, which had fallen apart and into the sewers on the night Bruce's parents were shot. This gift touched Bruce, and despite some initial problems, brought the two closer than ever.<\/p><h3>Death of the Family<\/h3><p>Over a year ago, Joker had escaped from Arkham and after tracking him down, Batman defeated him and put him back. There, Joker arranges for the Dollmaker to cut off his face before escaping, and his face is left in the GCPD. A year later, <a href=\"\/joker\/4005-1702\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker<\/a> makes his return by breaking into the GCPD, killing 19 police officers and reclaiming his face. He then proceeds to make a live broadcast saying that the mayor will die at midnight but ends up killing the mayor's entire staff instead.<\/p><p>After an encounter with Harley Quinn at ACE Chemicals, Batman goes back to Wayne Manor where he learns that Alfred was kidnapped. He realizes that Joker is reenacting his previous crimes, so he goes to the Gotham Reservoir to confront Joker. There, Joker paralyzes him with his venom, blows up the reservoir and tells him that he knows his secret identity before escaping.<\/p><p>Batman is brought back to the Batcave by the Bat-Family, where he confesses that after an early battle with the Joker, he discovered a joker playing card in the Batcave but denies the fact that Joker knows their identities. However, they are still unconvinced.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/140903\/2871162-995.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2871162\" data-ratio=\"1.3840830449827\" data-width=\"578\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 578px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/140903\/2871162-995.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2871162\"><img alt=\"Dinner Time!\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/140903\/2871162-995.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/140903\/2871162-995.jpg 578w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/14\/140903\/2871162-995.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/140903\/2871162-995.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dinner Time!\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/140903\/2871162-995.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/140903\/2871162-995.jpg 578w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/14\/140903\/2871162-995.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/14\/140903\/2871162-995.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dinner Time!<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Further investigation leads Batman to Arkham Asylum where he is attacked by Mr. Freeze, <a href=\"\/scarecrow\/4005-3726\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3726\">Scarecrow<\/a> and Clayface, whom Joker has labelled as Batman's loyal subjects.

The Joker reveals that Alfred is alive, but poisoned by Jokers venom and has him serving them all their apparently cut-off faces as \"dinner\". The Joker then sets the table on fire, but Batman breaks free and manages to put out the fire. Batman removes Damian's bandages and it's revealed that it was all a sick joke and everyone was fine. Batman goes after the Joker and defeats him. He tells the Joker that he knows who he is but an angered Joker refuses to believe that and jumps down the cave's waterfall. The next day, Batman says that the Joker didn't care who he was under the mask because it would ruin his fun. However, this entire ordeal caused a schism between the Bat-Family, as they no longer trust him because of his secrets.<\/p><h3>War with Leviathan and Death of Damian<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4293448\" data-ratio=\"0.76860537836148\" data-width=\"1599\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1599px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4293448\"><img alt=\"Death of Damian\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 1599w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Death of Damian\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 1599w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293448-25g7z9d.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Death of Damian<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Batman's war with Leviathan continues where it is revealed that the mastermind is none other than Talia Al Ghul in another attempt to have Batman by her side in her quest for world domination.

All of a sudden, Kathy Kane, agent of Spyral, a rival organization of the League of Assassins, comes in and shoots Talia in the head. Kathy, long thought to be dead, has been working with Batman in his war against Leviathan since the beginning and made a deal with him that once the war ends, Batman Inc. is disbanded.<\/p><p>Later on, Batman disbands Batman Incorporated and thanks his allies for the help and urges them to remember those who were lost including his son Damian. Bruce considers retiring the Batman mantle but realizes that there should always be a Batman.<\/p><p>However, he later discovers that Damian and Talia's bodies have been dug up and taken by none other than Ra's Al Ghul.<\/p><h3>Batman Eternal<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4293581\" data-ratio=\"0.77334465195246\" data-width=\"1178\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1178px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4293581\"><img alt=\"The event that started it all\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 1178w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The event that started it all\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 1178w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/54400\/4293581-bme1-16-17.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The event that started it all<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Commissioner Jim Gordon is arrested for manslaughter when he is tricked into shooting an electrical box, causing a massive train crash which kills hundreds of people.

The Architect attempts to destroy Wayne Tower but Batman manages to stop him. However, it is revealed that Bard has been working with the villain Hush, who infiltrated Wayne Manor, incapacitated Alfred, and stole from the Bat-Computer information about the locations of all of Batman weapon caches that are hidden around the city, and then detonated them, killing many people. In response, since all these depots are Wayne funded, Lucius Fox is forced to have Wayne Industries severe all ties with Batman, and as a result, Bruce Wayne loses much stock in his company and ends up bankrupt.<\/p><p>With Alfred injured, his daughter Julia Pennyworth, an S.A.S agent whom Batman previously met in Hong Kong, joins the fight and takes Alfred's place as his communication from the cave. With her help, Batman tracks down Hush and defeats him, but he discovers that Hush is merely another pawn, like Falcone. Bard, who holds a personal vendetta against Batman because a copycat vigilante caused the death of his partner and girlfriend, attempts to kill him by taking control of the Batmobile, but Batman survives and ends up threatening Bard. Because of his actions, the GCPD turns on Bard.<\/p><p>Mystical forces are at work at Arkham Asylum as part of an old villain known as Deacon Blackfire's machinations, in which his followers attempt in the story to bring him back. Batman sends Batwing and Jim Corrigan to investigate, but things go awry and Corrigan is forced to release the powerful fictional being called The Specter who destroys Arkham Asylum and puts an end to Blackfire's plans. Batman would later rescue Batwing from the wreckage.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, the Arkham escapees (Freeze, Scarecrow, Bane, Clayface, Joker's Daughter), who were taken down by Batman earlier, are freed by the mysterious benefactor, and they, along with other c-list criminals like Cluemaster, Signalman and Firefly, are presented with all of Batman's weapons and are told to use them in any way they please.<\/p><p>Batman is sent on a wild goose-chase, chasing down false leads and taking down rampaging enemies while his city burns. In the end, he receives an invitation to Wayne Tower where he is confronted, much to his surprise, by Cluemaster, who reveals himself to be the mastermind and that he had also deduced Batman's identity. Batman beats down Cluemaster, but the villain manages to gain the upper hand on the tired hero, but before the finishing blow, he is killed by the true mastermind, Lincoln March, who used Cluemaster, funded his plans and now wants to kill Batman himself.<\/p><p>In their final battle, the two found themselves in the middle of the city, with Batman too weak to fight, only to find Jim Gordon, having been cleared of his charges thanks to a guilt-ridden Bard, rallying Batman's allies and the entire city. March is then defeated but he manages to escape into the sewers, only to be caught by the Court of Owls, who intend to punish him for his betrayal.<\/p><h3>Batman: Rebirth<\/h3><h4>I Am Gotham<\/h4><p>While reestablishing his war on crime, Batman is dealing with a criminal who stole a missile and used it to knock a plane out of the sky. Batman manages to divert the plane away from the city but has to sacrifice his life in order to safely crash the plane. Before it crashes, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/gotham\/4005-130013\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-130013\">Gotham<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/gotham-girl\/4005-130014\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-130014\">Gotham Girl<\/a>, two new Superman-level heroes dedicating to saving Gotham City, save the plane and Batman. After the two are later seen fighting Solomon Grundy, Batman intervenes when the fight endangers a homeless man. At their request, he decides to show them the ropes. Along the way, Bruce wrestles with feelings of inadequacy over not having super-powers. While he helps them, he also tracks down their parents in hope of learning about their origins. He continues to help the two protect Gotham, but none of them is aware that Hugo Strange is behind the different incidents they have been tackling and that he has been monitoring them. While they team up to track down information on a suicide bomber, Batman leaves them to search for leads.<\/p><p>When he finds them again, he sees dozens of massacred soldiers, a missing Gotham, and Gotham Girl in a perpetual state of fear, a victim of <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/psycho-pirate\/4005-25495\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25495\">Psycho Pirate<\/a> and Strange working together. He then tracks down Gotham, who has become unhinged due to the Psycho Pirate altering his mind. Bruce tries talking him down, but when he mentions the dead soldiers, Gotham flies off. Seeking more information about what's happening to Gotham, Duke finds a lead connecting everything to <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/suicide-squad\/4060-40394\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40394\">Task Force X<\/a>. Bruce then breaks into <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/amanda-waller\/4005-4920\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4920\">Amanda Waller's<\/a> office demanding answers. Surprisingly, she is honest with him: she recruited Strange and Psycho Pirate to be her agents in Gotham, but they betrayed her and began driving people crazy, the most recent victim's being Gotham and Gotham Girl. She offers to help him if he says \"please,\" leaving him disgusted that she could make light of 27 dead agents. Amanda corrects him, saying she had <strong>28 <\/strong>agents. Batman then realizes why Gotham was in a rush earlier, and races to find him. He then returns to the residence of Gotham's parents and puts the pieces together. The last soldier secretly survived and managed to unmask Gotham long enough to track his face and find his parents, and went to kill the Gotham duo's parents to avenge his comrades.<\/p><p>Batman reaches the house to find he is too late: Gotham's parents are dead and Gotham himself is poised to kill the last soldier. Batman tries to talk him down, but Gotham kills the man anyway and leaves, as Psycho Pirate filled him with unquenchable rage that he now wants to unleash on the entire city. Batman is too far away to stop him, so he has Alfred dress up as him and stall. He then calls the Justice League, who arrive to subdue him. However, Gotham is too powerful, even for Superman. Unable to defeat him, Batman convinces Gotham that represents everything he hates about the city and to kill him instead. Before he can do so, Gotham Girl arrives, having temporarily beaten back the fear Psycho Pirate instilled into her. She then kills her brother, ending the threat.<\/p><p>In the aftermath, Gotham Girl resumes hero work, despite the fact that she is talking to her dead brother as though he is there. The following night, Duke monitors her progress from the Batcave and calls Bruce to let him know, and presses him about helping her. His response is simply, <em>I know<\/em>. Two days later, he catches up to Gotham Girl and tries to talk her down, and while he manages to reach her slightly, he fails to snap her out of her episode and she flies off. As he knocks out the criminal Gotham Girl stopped, he asks Alfred for advice on dealing with someone who has lost their family. However, seeing how Bruce turned out, he has no pertinent advice to offer. The next day, as she is flying over GCPD Headquarters, Batman shine the Bat-Signal on her to get her attention. This time, rather than offer her help, he asks her why she is ''helping'' the city. She explains that she is helping for a reason no one understands: because it eases the pain of losing their family. In a bid to reach her, he unmasks himself and tells her how he felt when his parents died. He hugs her and tells her that he still speaks to his mother to this day. With that, she finally opens, telling him she badly misses her brother. His response is, again, just <em>I know<\/em>.<\/p><p>The next day, Batman goes to talk to Waller again o find out where Psycho Pirate is. She explains that everything Strange did was part of a deal to trade Psycho Pirate for a supply of Venom large enough to have come from only one place <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/santa-prisca\/4020-56874\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56874\">Santa Prisca<\/a>, home of <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/bane\/4005-6129\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6129\">Bane<\/a>. Waller explains that to get to Psycho Pirate, he must invade a sovereign country, break into the most secure prison on Earth, and get his target away from Bane. However, she has a way to do it. However, it is a plan that is extremely risky, or as she calls it, <strong><em>suicidal.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><h2>Personality<\/h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2664527\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/134088\/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.51875\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/134088\/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2664527\"><img alt=\"Batman\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/134088\/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/134088\/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/134088\/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 632w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/134088\/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/134088\/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/134088\/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/134088\/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 632w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/134088\/2664527-tumblr_lypuvknpzf1qfbkomo1_1280.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Witnessing the death of his parents traumatized Batman and shook him so greatly that he swore he would devote every breath for the rest of his life to eliminating crime and criminals from Gotham City. This has, in turn, transformed Batman into a dark, suspicious and brooding figure with a personal grudge against injustice. His traumatized childhood has made it difficult for him to trust people other than Alfred Pennyworth and his various proteges the Robins. Despite his cold demeanour, Batman genuinely cares for Alfred, who he sees as a father figure, and the Robins, who he loves as his own children, though these relationships have been strained at some points.<\/p><p>His dedication to fighting crime has gradually turned into a sort of obsession, something with which Batman himself has come to terms. He has vowed to end the evil that took away his parents permanently and is willing to do everything he can to accomplish this goal. This obsession is balanced with his strong ideals of justice and moral values, which were instilled in him by his humanitarian parents. His dedication is backed up by his indomitable will and his strong resolve.<\/p><p>Despite his lack of powers, Batman's immense will, combined with his inventive mind and resourcefulness has allowed him to hold his own against more powerful foes. However, the biggest aspect of Batman's personality is his moral code. Despite his inventiveness, he refrains from killing as he believes that will make him no better than the criminals he puts behind bars. Batman knows that he walks a very thin line between sanity and insanity, and he believes that the only thing that keeps him from crossing that line is that he will not kill. He has vowed to never take a life under any circumstances because he fears what he would become in case he ever did kill. When confronted by Jason Todd on why he never killed the Joker after all the atrocities that he has committed, Batman responded that, despite his desires to do so, he will never do it because that would cause him to go to a dark place and become what he has always fought against, and he would never be able to come back.<\/p><p>Batman also has a deep love for humanity, which also backs his no-killing rule, and he truly believes that deep down, people can be good. This is shown when he was willing to give the Joker a second chance and offered to help him cure his madness. (This failed because the Joker had already \"re-insane-ized\" himself in advance, specifically to stay evil.) He also has an extreme distaste for firearms, and always tries to refrain from using them, because he considers the gun to be the weapon of cowards, the same weapon that killed his parents.<\/p><p>Batman has also forged an alternative personality to conceal the secrecy of his dual identity, that being the persona of \"Bruce Wayne,\" an irresponsible, clumsy, arrogant, womanizing, billionaire philanthropist. This personality contrasts with Batman's more serious demeanour in order to sway the public from ever deducing his secret identity. In order to complete his facade, Batman modifies many of his physical traits, including his voice tone, his body language, and, of course, his behaviour. However, even as Bruce Wayne, he has attempted to do good, through charitable campaigns, renovation projects and also the funding of Batman Incorporated.<\/p><h2>Character Profile<\/h2><ul><li><strong>Real Name:<\/strong> Bruce Wayne<\/li><li><strong>Occupation:<\/strong> Head of Wayne Industries, superhero\/vigilante<\/li><li><strong>Height:<\/strong> 6' 0\"<\/li><li><strong>Weight:<\/strong> 215 lbs<\/li><li><strong>Hair:<\/strong> Black<\/li><li><strong>Eyes:<\/strong> Blue<\/li><li><strong>Base:<\/strong> Gotham City<\/li><li><strong>Partnerships:<\/strong> <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Nightwing<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/alfred\/4005-5556\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5556\">Alfred Pennyworth<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/james-gordon\/4005-3727\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">Commissioner Gordon<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/barbara-gordon\/4005-5368\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Batgirl<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/damian-wayne\/4005-42413\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42413\">Robin<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/tim-drake\/4005-9290\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Red Robin<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/jason-todd\/4005-6849\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Red Hood<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/catwoman\/4005-1698\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1698\">The Catwoman<\/a>, <a href=\"\/leslie-thompkins\/4005-3740\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3740\">Leslie Thompkins<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/stephanie-brown\/4005-6156\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6156\">Spoiler<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/cassandra-cain\/4005-65230\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65230\">Black Bat<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/superman\/4005-1807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/jean-paul-valley\/4005-12834\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12834\">Azreal<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/harvey-bullock\/4005-5554\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5554\">Harvey Bullock<\/a>, <a href=\"\/renee-montoya\/4005-3716\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3716\">Renee Montoya<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/talia-al-ghul\/4005-4917\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4917\">Talia al Ghul<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/man-bat\/4005-6131\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6131\">Man-Bat<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/batwoman\/4005-9052\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9052\">Batwoman<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/zatanna\/4005-5691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5691\">Zatanna<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/kathy-kane\/4005-81174\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81174\">Kathy Kane<\/a>, <a href=\"\/bat-mite\/4005-23170\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23170\">Batmite<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ace-the-bat-hound\/4005-31302\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31302\">Ace the Bat-Hound<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/carrie-kelley\/4005-13164\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13164\">Carrie Kelley<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/wonder-woman\/4005-2048\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/creeper\/4005-5713\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5713\">The Creeper<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/deadman\/4005-5690\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5690\">Deadman<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/silver-st-cloud\/4005-22134\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22134\">Silver St. Cloud<\/a>, <a href=\"\/julie-madison\/4005-38196\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38196\">Julie Madison<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>Though he does not possess any innate superhuman abilities, Batman is considered by many (even <a href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman<\/a>) to be among the most dangerous men in the world. Throughout the many years that he has been around, Batman has become one of the most powerful human beings in the DC Universe, despite having no superhuman powers at any time in his life. Starting at the age of 14, Bruce began to train with brilliant minds on the planet to learn about biology, criminology, anatomy and other areas that would help him become the World's Greatest Detective.<\/p><h4>Jack-of-All-Trades and Master of Many<\/h4><p>Batman is also a master of stealth, disguise, and escapology, using his <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/ninjutsu\/4015-56310\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56310\">Ninjutsu<\/a> training. He has infiltrated high-security strongholds and systems including Lexcorp. He has vanished in plain sight from regular humans and <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/metahuman\/4015-55705\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55705\">metahumans<\/a>, such as <a href=\"\/azrael\/4005-25845\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25845\">Azrael<\/a>.

He is the second greatest escape artist, behind <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/mr-miracle\/4005-5703\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5703\">Mr. Miracle<\/a>. Batman has escaped a straitjacket in 52 seconds, then stated that it was too slow for him. He always carries several lockpicks with him. He commonly uses disguises, his most notable one being Matches Malone.<\/p><h4>Large Supply of Money and Resources<\/h4><p>To acquire all of these skills, Bruce needed money. When his parents died, Bruce inherited millions of dollars from the Wayne Fortune which he later turned into billions through investing.

He is also fluent in many different languages such as English, Spanish, French, Russian, German, Japanese, Chinese, and others. Bruce has a vast knowledge of criminology, psychology, medicine, and anatomy. Batman is an excellent strategist and always keeps himself steps ahead of his opponents.This incredible ability is due to the fact he studies his opponents, not only physically but also mentally. He has led the Justice League, the Bat-family, the Outsiders, and served as a mentor for the Justice League International. He is a highly knowledgeable in business, great in finances and marketing. He has earned degrees in multiple subjects before the age of 25. He has hacked into alien and future technology.<\/p><h4>Master Martial Artist<\/h4><p>Batman has been said to be trained in every martial art known to man, and out of every single one of those forms of fighting, he knows 127 that are deadly. These 127 are the main forms of fighting that make up his normal fighting style. He is known to change his styles in order to become unpredictable to his opponents. His primary style of combat though is a mixture of <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/judo\/4015-56983\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56983\">Judo<\/a>, Ninjitsu, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/muay-thai\/4015-57066\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-57066\">Muay Thai<\/a>, Tae Kwon Do, Jujitsu, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/boxing\/4015-56433\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56433\">Boxing<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/karate\/4015-56436\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56436\">Karate<\/a> and Dragon Style Kung Fu.<\/p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2530506\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/131238\/2530506-batweightraining.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5681470137825\" data-width=\"653\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 653px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/131238\/2530506-batweightraining.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2530506\"><img alt=\"Batman's Daily Routine\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/131238\/2530506-batweightraining.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/131238\/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 653w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/131238\/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/131238\/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 408w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman's Daily Routine\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/131238\/2530506-batweightraining.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/131238\/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 653w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/131238\/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/131238\/2530506-batweightraining.jpg 408w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman's Daily Routine<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Because of his training, Batman has also mastered nearly all weapons known to man, even most firearms--even though he despises these last, considering them cowards' weapons, and repeatedly avoids using them himself. Batman's combat skill surpasses most metahumans and normal men, and he even knows every pressure point and nerve strike in the human body, as well as Dim Mak (\"death touch\") techniques. These can cause dangerous pain to his enemies which can lead to dizziness, numbness, unconsciousness, temporary paralysis, disorientation, and even death.<\/p><h4>Peak Human Conditioning<\/h4><p>Due to his intense training and diet, Batman has accomplished feats that normal human beings might call superhuman. Batman is in peak physical and mental condition. Batman has displayed surprising strength, and is able to bench press weight of at least 1000 pounds, and has personally stated that his maximum leg press weight is 2500 lbs (over 1.133 Kg). However, as shown in <a href=\"\/batman-odyssey-2-part-8\/4000-304597\/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-304597\"><em>Batman Odyssey #2<\/em><\/a>, Batman was able to overcome his personal record leg press, moving, with the strength of the legs, a stuck railroad car. In <a href=\"\/batman-gotham-after-midnight-2-may-he-lye-stille\/4000-134011\/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-134011\"><em>Batman: Gotham After Midnight #2<\/em><\/a>, Batman was able to hold up two golden sarcophagi with the approximate weight of at least 1 ton, for at least one minute. In addition, Batman is an accomplished <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/gymnastics\/4015-56642\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56642\">gymnast<\/a> and acrobat, though not quite at the level of <a href=\"\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Nightwing<\/a>. Batman's training and peak condition mean he's very fast, both in combat and on his feet. This speed combined with his strength makes him phenomenally powerful; even the enhanced assassin <a href=\"\/deathstroke\/4005-3588\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3588\">Deathstroke<\/a> has commented upon the power and skill of the Batman. He once grabbed Green Arrow's arrow shot at him in mid-air and dodged point-blank fire at times. He can hold his breath for 3 minutes and 15 seconds. He once survived in an airless vacuum of space for exactly 27 seconds.<\/p><h2>Weapons and Equipment<\/h2><h3>Gadgets<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1786207\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86187\/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5787037037037\" data-width=\"648\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 648px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:157.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86187\/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1786207\"><img alt=\"Batman - David Finch\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" data-width=\"405\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86187\/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86187\/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 648w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/86187\/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 608w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86187\/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 405w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman - David Finch\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86187\/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86187\/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 648w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/86187\/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 608w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86187\/1786207-batmanpaintingbydavidfinch.jpg 405w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" data-width=\"405\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman - David Finch<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Batman is most notable for his use of <a href=\"..\/..\/utility-belt\/18-46369\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">gadgetry<\/a>. Due to his wealth, money is no obstacle to the development of various gadgets and paraphernalia he uses in fighting crime. The most recognizable of these is the Batarang, a razor throwing weapon that has a returning ability similar to a boomerang. This was slowly replaced by his grappling hook as a favoured gadget over time. Other items include smoke or flash grenades, caltrops, a re-breather, and various types of anti-venom. The heels of his boots have a sonic device which can summon a swarm of bats to his location. This allows for dramatic escapes or diversions to keep his enemies busy. Superman entrusted Batman with a green kryptonite-jewelled ring in order to stop him should he ever go rogue.<\/p><h4>Bat-Suit<\/h4><p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/bat-suit\/4055-55745\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55745\">Bat-Suit<\/a> is an experimental military body armour that is too expensive for the military to produce. Various bat-suit designs have appeared over the years, but all maintain the fact that Bruce's suit is tear resistant, bulletproof, and immune to temperature extremes(it will not melt if in contact with fire, etc.). The suit is shock absorbent and acid resistant. It is made to rebound punches and kicks. When he is unable to defend himself, his mask emits knock out gas and electrical shocks to attackers who are attempting to remove any part of his gear.<\/p><p>The Bat-Suit has shown that it has an outer layer that can be shed when trapped, and it also masks any DNA on his suit. However, despite all this protection, the suit has shown vulnerabilities to sharp objects, like knives, and Batman has sometimes decreased the amount of armour in the suit to increase mobility. In the past, Batman wore a bright yellow chest plate with a bat-symbol on it, to distract enemies from targeting his face and instead focusing on the plate which is reinforced with kevlar, giving Batman extra protection.<\/p><h3>Cowl<\/h3><p>The cowl has a computer link directly to the Bat-computer. The mask has a hollow bat-ear assembly containing a directional microphone, telescoping high gain antenna and a fibre optic coaxial cable. It also contains an audio processor that can transmit and receive audio which can be augmented for better hearing, or even completely shut down when dealing with an opponent that uses sonic weaponry. The cowl contains a built-in recorder that is constantly recording, and the information is stored in the cowl archives for later reference. The lens can also magnify his vision and serves also as a lie detector. They also come with x-ray, thermal, sonar, and night vision. It has face recognition and can give information about the people around him. It also protects him against throat trauma, and its internal comm-link enables voice command over various equipment including grapple hooks, face recognition software and vehicles.<\/p><h3>Gloves\/Gauntlets<\/h3><p>Batman's gloves, or gauntlets, are very handy as in addition to covering his hands so that he will not leave fingerprints behind, they come with a high-velocity Bat-rope and a wrist laser. They can also emit a high voltage surge of electricity to stun enemies and shoot, out their forearms, spikes, smoke pellets and anaesthetic gas. Each gauntlet has three spiked fringes emerging from it, and they can be fired at an opponent or used to defend against or even break the blades of, swords.<\/p><h3>Cape<\/h3><p>Throughout many revisions, all the versions of Batman's cape still retain the scalloped wing design at the bottom of the cape, which is instrumental in intimidating criminals. The cape is made from a \"memory fiber,\" which is based on a nylon derivative, allowing it to flow like any fabric, but through an electrical surge applied by Batman's gloves, it becomes stiff and takes on a distinctive shape, thus functioning in a way similar to a parachute, used to slow Batman's fall and allow him short-range \"gliding\" flight. It is flame-resistant (to temperatures which have not been conclusively gauged) and can be used to help conceal Batman in the shadows, to protect him from debris as a result from explosions, and even, sometimes, as a weapon in combat.<\/p><h3>Utility Belt<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-118292\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/118292-44795-batman.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/118292-44795-batman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-118292\"><img alt=\"Batman's toys\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/118292-44795-batman.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/118292-44795-batman.jpg 360w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman's toys\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/118292-44795-batman.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/77\/118292-44795-batman.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman's toys<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Batman\u2019s <a href=\"..\/..\/utility-belt\/18-46369\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Belt<\/a> is one of his most iconic pieces of equipment.

From the ages of 8 to 14, he practiced knot tying, acting, acrobatics, martial arts, and a lot of science, math and languages. To help him learn all of that, Bruce taught himself speed-reading, total recall and lip-reading. He was also gifted with some skills that helped him along the way, such as an estimated IQ of 192 and the Wayne's fortune, he also has a great memory and is good with numbers and learning which suggests he might have synesthesia. Bruce is suspected to be ambidextrous, meaning he can use both hands of the dominant one. He had a lot of mind-training and graduated at the age of 14.<\/p><p>After that, for the next six years, he obtained all of the best college educations in the world, learning only the courses he believed were important for him. In his spare time, he studied the criminal world and trained under the detectives <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/harvey-harris\/4005-39614\/\">Harvey Harris<\/a> and Dan Mallory, and also took boxing lessons from Ted Grant, AKA <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/wildcat\/4005-7645\/\">Wildcat<\/a>, who was the world's heavyweight boxing champion. At the age of 20 he became an FBI agent, which was his original goal, in the FBI training, Bruce scored perfectly on each category, except gun handling, because he refused to use a gun.<\/p><p>After six weeks in the FBI, he decided it wasn't for him and quit. To train himself, he traveled east to find the best martial artists in the world and train under them. A lot of his training in from now on, are unknown, but the comics did show that his first training was in an ancient temple in the Peak Tucson mountains in Korea. It took him 40,000 dollars in bribes, and six weeks to get there, but he managed to train there under the legendary martial artist <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/kirigi\/4005-66775\/\">Kirigi<\/a>, learning things based of peace, patience and clearing of the mind, and more mental training. It is suspected that in his year of training he managed to learn every Korean fighting style. Next, Bruce went to France and worked with a detective called Henry Ducard, known to be able to track down every man in the world. Bruce stopped working with him after he found out about his brutal way of operation, so he searched and found Willy Doggett, another investigator and tracker.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11135\/111350431\/6419749-fight+-+bruce+wayne.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6419749\" data-ratio=\"0.80838323353293\" data-width=\"501\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 501px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11135\/111350431\/6419749-fight+-+bruce+wayne.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6419749\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11135\/111350431\/6419749-fight+-+bruce+wayne.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11135\/111350431\/6419749-fight+-+bruce+wayne.png 501w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11135\/111350431\/6419749-fight+-+bruce+wayne.png 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11135\/111350431\/6419749-fight+-+bruce+wayne.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11135\/111350431\/6419749-fight+-+bruce+wayne.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11135\/111350431\/6419749-fight+-+bruce+wayne.png 501w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11135\/111350431\/6419749-fight+-+bruce+wayne.png 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11135\/111350431\/6419749-fight+-+bruce+wayne.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Chu Chin Li taught him Kong-Fu and Shihan Matsuda taught him Tummo meditation, a technique that he can use to get complete control over the functions of his mind, limit the amount of oxygen he needs to survive, control his body temperature and make him fall into a comma if he wants to. The technique also helped him improve his physical abilities and concentration. David Kane, a martial arts expert, taught Bruce several new fighting styles, and then he went to Russia to improve his engineering skills under a mad genius called Sergei. He learned Taoism to channel his rage and inner peace, pushing him to new physical levels. He has also studied with <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/richard-dragon\/4005-2221\/\">Richard Dragon<\/a>, one of the best martial artists in the world, John Zatara, an escape artist and magician (who is also the father of <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/zatanna\/4005-5691\/\">Zatanna<\/a>). He also trained with many other martial arts experts that we don't know their names, assassins, sword fighting experts and military leaders. Bruce used the Uberman sleep schedule to help his mind go through the critical parts of sleeping fast, so he only needs to sleep 2-3 hours every night, which saved him a lot of time. After five years of the training mentioned above, and much more, he came back to Gotham to start his journey as The Batman. Although not all of his training is known, it was mentioned that Batman has learned all 127 martial arts known to man.<\/p><h2>Alternate Realities<\/h2><p>Throughout the universe, there is more than one Earth. This meaning that there are alternate timelines\/futures and people that are unique in their own special way. From the events of the multiple Crisis, most of the Earths have been erased from history. Only 52 Earths remain in the entire universe.<\/p><h3>Earth-11<\/h3><p>On this gender-swapped Earth, Batman is Batwoman. Her real name is Helena Wayne, who is the daughter of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle. She took up the mantle of the Bat after her father passed away.<\/p><h3>Earth-2<\/h3><p>On this earth, Batman retired as a police commissioner and married Selina Kyle (Catwoman). They had a daughter named Helena Wayne, also known as the Huntress.<\/p><p>Post-Flashpoint, Earth-2's Batman fought alongside Superman and Wonder Woman against the forces of Apokolips, and in the process died saving the planet. His daughter is transported to the main DC Universe along with Earth-2's Supergirl, and there they take on the persona of the Huntress and Power Girl.<\/p><p>Current issues from the Earth-2 series have revealed that someone has taken up the cape and cowl of Batman. However, this new Batman uses gadgets designed to kill and has been shown to be more than willing to kill criminals with rather brutal force.<\/p><h3>Earth-3<\/h3><p>On this third Earth, Bruce Wayne is actually Thomas Wayne, Jr. He is the son of the wealthy\/powerful Thomas and Martha Wayne. This Earth did have a Bruce Wayne in the family, Thomas Wayne, Jr.'s little brother, however, after the multitudes of crisis that have happened in the DC Universe, he was erased from continuity. Instead, Thomas Wayne, Jr. is the mirror reflection of Bruce Wayne\/Batman of New Earth. Thomas Wayne Jr.'s parents died and he inherited their fortune. He decided to train with assassins, mercenaries and masters of various skills to be a force of evil. As an adult, Thomas Wayne, Jr. finds out that his father survived and is the Commissioner of the Gotham City police force. Thomas Wayne, Sr. knows that his son is Owlman and has decided to dedicate his life to bringing his son to Justice. Thomas Wayne Jr. hates his father for this and wants to kill him. He is the founder\/leader of the <a href=\"..\/..\/crime-syndicate-of-amerika\/65-41531\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crime Syndicate<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Earth-1<\/h3><p>Retelling the story of Bruce Wayne and his transformation from billionaire playboy to Dark Knight, creator\/writer <a href=\"..\/..\/geoff-johns\/26-40439\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geoff Johns<\/a> recreates Batman's origin to go along with the Earth-1 storyline. Earth-1 is to not be considered the \"main Earth\" or New Earth as it is called, however, Bruce will be travelling around the world in search of retribution for his parent's death. This story came out in late 2011, with artist <a href=\"..\/..\/gary-frank\/26-1824\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gary Frank<\/a> also working on the Graphic Novel.<\/p><h4>Earth-31<\/h4><p>On this Earth, Batman was 55 in The Dark Knight Returns. Having retired following Jason Todd's death, crime began to rise to an all-time high in Gotham and times were worse than ever. Bruce had to don his Batman persona once again. Fighting various criminals\/friends from the good old days, Batman is equipped with a 13-year-old female <a href=\"..\/..\/carrie-kelly\/29-13164\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robin<\/a> who will help Batman in his war on crime. Bruce has retired twice in this world and has to always come back to clean up after the government and their mess. Earth-31's Batman is a much darker Batman.<\/p><h4>Earth-43<\/h4><p>On Earth-43, Bruce Wayne\/Batman was bitten by a female Vampire named Tanya, to oppose the king of vampires, Dracula. Tanya was a vampire that refused to draw on the blood of humans and only wants to protect them from Dracula and his vampires. Tanya bites Batman, but instead of drawing blood, she transferred him new powers. Batman grew a disliking of the sun and gained incredible strength, speed, and agility. He also had the ability to grow wings in human form and become one with the shadows. While not wanting the blood of others, he had to use Tanya's a substitute to control the hunger. Most of Batman's villains were drained of blood when Tanya's was no longer sufficient. When this occurred, Bruce had already morphed into a giant bat-like monster with fangs. Part of Batman's psyche and detective abilities stayed, but he is starting to lose it slowly. Since he wasn't a full vampire, he is hit with a stake in the heart and changed back to human form. Batman of Earth-43 still stands guard over his Gotham, but with the mark of a vampire.<\/p><h3>Flashpoint<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1701986\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"384\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 384px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1701986\"><img alt=\"Thomas Wayne as Batman\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg 384w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Thomas Wayne as Batman\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1701986-flsp_pbkv_cv1.jpg 384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Thomas Wayne as Batman<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In <a href=\"..\/..\/flashpoint\/39-56280\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flashpoint<\/a>, the DC Universe's continuity thriller, the world has gone to hell.

Near Batman's early creation, Ed Herron created this planet to give Batman abilities like Superman. Batman had all Superman's abilities and even a special weakness. In this comic, the Batman native to the planet was just a regular Batman like Bruce Wayne of Earth-1, with the name Kent Wayne (a combination of Bruce and Clark). He was raised by a rich family of farmers and when they eventually died, he became Batman. When Bruce Wayne came to his planet, Zur-En-Arrh Batman envied him because of how he was doing a greater job at Batman than he was. Eventually, Batman was weakened by a material on that planet, and Zur-En-Arrh had to remove his powers. After Crisis on Infinite Earths, this planet has been said to be erased from continuity.<\/p><h3>Earth-5<\/h3><p>On Earth-5, Bruce Wayne is only 8 years of age. Thomas and Martha Wayne are a rich family in Gotham City. Thomas is the legendary Batman with Martha as Batwoman. Bruce loves Batman and Batwoman and how they saved people. When he found out that his parents were his heroes, Thomas had no choice but to train him. With months of training, Bruce Wayne became Robin - The Boy Wonder.<\/p><h3>Arkham City Earth<\/h3><p>This Earth is similar to DC main continuity Earth-0 (New Earth); however, it differs from much of Batman's story. Still having his parents brutally murdered by a criminal, Bruce decides to devote his life to fighting crime in Gotham City. Years later, Batman finds himself in Arkham Asylum with Joker (and other Batman rogues) running the show; Batman locks himself in the asylum to stop Joker. Joker plans to create super thugs with the new Titan formula (a variation on the <a href=\"\/venom\/4055-47184\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-47184\">Venom<\/a> serum). Batman stops a Titan-infected Joker, but the serum's effects make Joker very sick. A year later, Quincy Sharp, the former warden of Arkham Asylum and now the mayor of Gotham, closes the Asylum and places Arkham inside Gotham City. Batman is trying to prevent Gotham from destroying itself because of the Mayor's choice. This occurs in the <a href=\"\/batman-arkham-city\/4050-40090\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-40090\">Batman: Arkham City<\/a> mini-series.<\/p><h3>Earth-7642<\/h3><p>This Earth, otherwise known as the Crossover Earth, is where DC main continuity coexists with the Marvel 616 universe. <a href=\"\/spider-man\/4005-1443\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man<\/a> visits Gotham City after a psychologist, Cassandra Briar, believes she can cure the <a href=\"\/joker\/4005-1702\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker<\/a> of his insanity with a cranial microchip the same way she did <a href=\"\/carnage\/4005-1490\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1490\">Carnage<\/a>.

The Joker does not trust Conrad and attempts to double-cross him as he sends Harley and Conrad to retrieve the codes to use the device. <a href=\"\/abbey-chase\/4005-17820\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17820\">Abbey<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sydney-savage\/4005-17825\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17825\">Sydney<\/a> come across Bruce Wayne, who invite them to a gala.

After growing jealous of Superman, Pyotr convinces Batman to work with him to take down Superman. Batman agrees but warns Pyotr that after Superman is taken care of, he's next. Batman lures Superman by kidnapping Wonder Woman. Once Superman was in position, Batman bombarded him with red sunlight in order to weaken him. After beating up the weakened Superman to a pulp Batman locked him in a cellar, unfortunately for him, Superman managed to convince Wonder Woman to destroy her lasso and destroy the lamps. When his plan failed Batman told Superman of Pyotr's treachery and committed suicide but Superman had no powers in a red sun only a yellow.<\/p><p>This wasn't the end of The Batman as other men have taken up the mantle after his death and brought justice to the streets of Russia.<\/p><h3>Injustice<\/h3><p>In this universe, Batman is one of the few renaming heroes to not join Superman's side after the destruction of Metropolis by the Joker. The Joker had tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane, who was carrying Superman's unborn child. Lois was also the trigger to an atomic bomb that the Joker had placed in Metropolis. Once Lois died, the bomb went off. Batman took the Joker into an interrogation room, but Superman came looking for the Joker. Superman impaled the Joker, thus killing him.<\/p><p>For the next few days and weeks, Batman stays off-site, watching from afar as Superman starts to take action in order to stop all conflict around the world. But when Batman learns that the President tried to take Superman's parents as a hostage, Batman shows up at the President's office. He states that he can't be naive to think he could touch Superman's parents and there not be any retaliation. Batman also tells the President that his actions have only helped strengthen Superman's cause and that it will help rally other heroes to Superman's side.<\/p><p>Superman flies to the Batcave and confronts Batman about why he didn't help save his parents. Batman replies that he was doing other things that needed to be done. This angers Superman since he would have thought Batman would have known best how it feels like to have his parents taken away. Batman also replies that Superman and the others are scaring everyone on Earth. Superman and Batman then have a long debate about Superman's actions in recent days. After Superman leaves, Batman connects to the Justice League communication centre and contacts Aquaman, warning him that Superman will soon want him to join.<\/p><p>When a new superhero by the name of Galaxor, is defeated by the rest of Justice League, Batman patches into the Flash's communicator and tells the Flash to a local research department. Their the Flash learns that Galaxor was a fan of the Justice League and the Flash was one of his idols who he looked up to. Batman tells Barry how he thinks Galaxor felt the moment when the same Justice League teams he looked up to was close to killing him for standing up for what he thought was wrong.<\/p><p>A few hours later, Batman, Nightwing and Robin learn from a live news report that Arkham has been taken over and all of the inmates have been released. But given what has happened Robin (Damien Wayne), believes that Batman is doing things all wrong. The Joker could have been prevented from killing everyone in Metropolis if Batman had stopped locking him up in Arkham and Batman should have just killed him. Batman tells Damien that there is no time to argue but Damien refuses to listen to Batman anymore and decided to side with Superman.<\/p><p>Batman arrives before Superman and his team at Arkham. But when Superman, Wonder Woman and the rest make it, Batman exclaims that they don't have the right to decided how to deal with how the prisoners of Arkham will be handled. As Batman argues, he sees that Damien is with Superman and he didn't stay in the Batcave like his father had ordered him to do. The cells begin to open and one by one the prisoners begin to vanish. Batman deduces that the Flash is behind it and he tells Superman to tell him at once where the prisoners are being taken to. Cyborg is about to attack Batman but is stopped by Green Arrow. Batman asks which side Green Arrow is with, but Green Arrow only states that he is at Arkham to drop of Harley Quin. Just at that moment Killer Croc and Soloman Grundy begin their attack. Batman is pinned down by Croc and is about to be attacked by other supervillains until Green Arrow manages to help free Batman. Batman meets up with Robin and Nightwing to make sure they are both okay and he then tells them to go help stop the other villains who are free. Batman engages Grundy in battle. Batman is able to defeat Grundy but tells Superman that they need to get him back to his cell. When Batman comes back out of the hole, he finds Robin holding the lifeless body of Nightwing in his arms. Shocked, Batman yells and demands to know what happened to Nightwing. Batman shoves Robin out of the way and starts to have flashbacks to the night that Bruce's parents were killed. Batman carries Dick's body out of Arkham and the only thing that Batman can say is \" He's gone. I've abandoned again. My son is dead\". Batman is then seen in the Batcave, punching a training post, furiously to the point where he has given himself bloody knuckles. Catwomen arrives and she begins to comfort him and he begins to cry in her arms.<\/p><p>After a few days of grieving, until he reports to the top of Gotham police station. The Bat Signal was on and Batman was expecting to talk to Jim Gordon but finds the President was the one who turned on the BatSignal. The President and Batman move to a more secure location, where the President gives Batman information about what Superman and the other heroes have been doing in recent days. Batman states that peace can't be enforced like how Superman is doing and Batman knowns why he was called by the President. If Superman does take over, Batman is the only one who can take him down. Before Batman leaves the room, he tells the President that he voted for him, making him laugh.<\/p><p>Batman and Catwomen then split up and start to recruit other heroes to their side. Heroes such as Green Arrow, Black Lighting and Captain Atom are recruited by Batman. When Hawkgirl tries to kidnap a world leader, Batman's team stops her. They take Hawkeye girl back to the Batcave and Catwomen asks Batman how he knew she was going to be there. Batman only replies by saying \"I can't say\". Catwomen keeps asking Batman what his goal is, and Batman tells her that they only need to keep her locked up for a week. Catwomen explains that the Justice League will come for her in no time, but Batman explains that the Justice League doesn't even know that she's missing.<\/p><h2>Batman in Other Media<\/h2><h3>Film<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3347724\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/120019\/3347724-5651927815-batma.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.41666666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:41.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/120019\/3347724-5651927815-batma.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3347724\"><img alt=\"The live-action versions of Batman (1989 - 2012)\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/120019\/3347724-5651927815-batma.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/120019\/3347724-5651927815-batma.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/120019\/3347724-5651927815-batma.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/120019\/3347724-5651927815-batma.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The live-action versions of Batman (1989 - 2012)\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/120019\/3347724-5651927815-batma.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/120019\/3347724-5651927815-batma.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/120019\/3347724-5651927815-batma.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/120019\/3347724-5651927815-batma.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The live-action versions of Batman (1989 - 2012)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A full list of <a href=\"movies\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman's movies can be found here<\/a>.<\/p><p>In 1943 The Batman made his debut in a film serial simply titled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/the-batman\/4025-199\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-199\"><em>The Batman<\/em><\/a>, which starred Lewis Wilson as the Batman alongside Douglas Croft as Robin. The film serial was made during WWII; there is, in fact, a villainous Japanese scientist named Dr. Daka (J. Carroll Naish in yellow-face) as the villain. Though it was critically bashed, the film serial did introduce the concept of the Batcave as well as a thin Alfred, prompting DC to remake the comics version of the version known more recently. A second film serial series was launched, this one titled <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/batman-and-robin\/4025-222\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-222\"><em>Batman And Robin,<\/em><\/a> starring Robert Lowery as Batman, which followed Batman's and Robin's battle with the mad scientist The Wizard. Other characters in these films include Vicki Vale, Alfred, and Commissioner Gordon. With a higher budget and more solid acting, it is considered superior to the previous serial, but it still had errors with equipment and continuity, like the previous serial. Decades later, Batman returned to the big screen with <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/batman\/4025-4\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-4\">Batman<\/a><\/em> (1989) and <a href=\"\/batman-returns\/4025-7\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-7\"><em>Batman Returns<\/em><\/a> (1992). Directed by <a href=\"\/tim-burton\/4040-61388\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-61388\">Tim Burton<\/a>, the two movies were darker and more serious than any comic book movie before and were both big hits critically and financially. In 1995 Joel Schumacher made the third instalment, named <a href=\"\/batman-forever\/4025-8\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-8\"><em>Batman Forever,<\/em><\/a> which tried to make Batman more family-friendly by introducing Robin and adding a sillier, more comedic tone akin to the '60s Adam West show. The movie received mixed reviews but was a hit at the box office, which led to Schumacher making a fourth instalment, titled <em><a href=\"\/batman-robin\/4025-10\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-10\">Batman and Robin<\/a>.<\/em> The film was a massive disappointment with both critics and audiences alike, and it effectively killed that version of the Batman franchise.<\/p><p>In 2005, director Christopher Nolan brought Batman back to the big screen with <em><a href=\"\/batman-begins\/4025-12\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-12\">Batman Begins<\/a>.<\/em> This was followed by 2008's <a href=\"\/the-dark-knight\/4025-15\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-15\"><em>The Dark Knight,<\/em><\/a> which grossed over 1 billion dollars worldwide, making Batman a legitimate box-office presence.

The 1960s series was intended to be a lampoon comedy show because of producer William Dozier's initial ignorance of comic books; this likewise gave Dozier, who also narrated the series, the idea to \"overdo\" the series. The stories, some of which were actually drawn from DC Comics issues of <em>Batman<\/em> and\/or <em>Detective Comics,<\/em> followed a format that was villain-driven and action-comedy heavy, and they tended to need two parts to complete. The first part usually involved a villain committing a crime with Batman and Robin attempting to stop the criminal, only to be caught and put in a death trap; the second part consisted of the Bat-Duo escaping and eventually capturing the villains. The series is notable for the high profile guest stars, most of whom appeared as Batman's enemies. One of these, <a href=\"\/joker\/4005-1702\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">the Joker<\/a>, as whom <a href=\"\/cesar-romero\/4040-77388\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-77388\">Cesar Romero<\/a> guested on an almost semi-regular basis, was shown in colour for the first time in this program, and Ben Nye Sr.'s make-up format was later adapted for <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/jack-nicholson\/4040-68833\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-68833\">Jack Nicholson's<\/a> use in Burton's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comicvine.com\/batman\/4025-4\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-4\">1989 film<\/a>.<\/p><p>The series also led to a cinematic adaptation called<em><a href=\"\/batman-the-movie\/4025-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-55\"> Batman: The Movie<\/a>.<\/em><\/p><p><em>Batman: The Live-Action Situation Comedy Television Series,<\/em> which was not legitimately released on home video (in DVD or Blu-ray forms) till 2014 because of numerous legal hassles over copyright ownership of the series, is credited with actually having saved the character from dismal sales of the comics that were actually bringing them to the verge of folding, and also with enabling a new generation to come to know the character as he had once been and, indeed, as he had truly been intended to be.<\/p><h3>Animation through the '60s, the '70's, and the '80s<\/h3><p>Through the years Batman has spent more years animated on television than in a live action series. Starting in 1968, Batman and Robin made their animated debuts in an hour-long series called <em>The Batman\/Superman Hour.<\/em> This program, a Filmation Associates production, featured Olan Soule as Batman and Casey Kasem as Robin. The Bat-Duo were featured in numerous animated shorts which had Batman and Robin battle various Batman villains, as well as teaming up with Batgirl. These shorts eventually were repackaged as a solo TV series titled Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder, which ignored other segments in favour of solo Batman and Robin Adventures. Soule and Kasem would reprise their roles in the Scooby-Doo Movies featuring Scooby and the Gang meeting Batman and Robin while battling Joker and Penguin.<\/p><p>In 1977 running concurrently with <a href=\"\/super-friends\/4075-185\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-185\"><em>Challenge of the Super Friends<\/em><\/a> was <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/the-new-adventures-of-batman\/4075-689\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-689\"><em>The New Adventures of Batman<\/em><\/a>, featuring Batman, Robin, Batgirl and the creature called Bat-Mite, fighting the Gotham Rogues, both classic and newly created villains. (This constituted the previously mentioned Batman segments of Tarzan and the Super 7.) Because of Adam West's and Burt Ward's involvements in the show, it could be considered a continuation of the 1960s Batman series. Due to copyright issues, however, <em>Challenge of the Super Friends<\/em> had the use of the Riddler and the Scarecrow, making them off-limits to <em>The New Adventures of Batman,<\/em> while this series had use of the Joker, preventing his use in <em>Challenge<\/em> as a Legion of Doom member.<\/p><h3>DC Animated Universe<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-3347726\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/120019\/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.57176470588235\" data-width=\"425\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 425px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/120019\/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3347726\"><img alt=\"Batman: The Animated Series\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/120019\/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/120019\/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg 425w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/120019\/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman: The Animated Series\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/120019\/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/120019\/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg 425w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/120019\/3347726-7897192410-135182.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman: The Animated Series<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Starting in 1992 the critically acclaimed <a href=\"..\/..\/dc-animated-universe\/12-44865\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DC Animated Universe<\/a> series of animated TV shows began, consisting of <em><a href=\"\/batman-the-animated-series\/4075-17\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-17\">Batman: The Animated Series<\/a>,<\/em> <em><a href=\"\/superman-the-animated-series\/4075-12\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-12\">Superman: The Animated Series<\/a>,<\/em> <em>The New Batman\/Superman Adventures,<\/em> <em><a href=\"\/batman-beyond\/4075-116\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-116\">Batman Beyond<\/a>,<\/em> <em><a href=\"\/justice-league\/4075-47\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-47\">Justice League<\/a>,<\/em> <em><a href=\"\/justice-league-unlimited\/4075-57\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-57\">Justice League Unlimited<\/a>,<\/em> <em><a href=\"\/static-shock\/4075-153\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-153\">Static Shock<\/a><\/em> and <em><a href=\"\/the-zeta-project\/4075-380\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-380\">The Zeta Project<\/a>;<\/em> all of these shared both continuity and the involvement of actor Kevin Conroy as Batman. Throughout all these shows, a history of Bruce Wayne was recounted, from his childhood to glory days and dark times as well as him as an older man in retirement.<\/p><p>Many of the scripts of all the shows featured Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, Paul Dini, Dwayne McDuffie, Stan Berkowitz and Hilary Bader, creating a Batman that was very consistent in between all shows. All of the series have been met with acclaim due to the treatment of subject matter that told stories in a way that was child-friendly but still attracted older audiences.<\/p><p>This is true especially for the treatment of Batman staying true to many versions of him and having stories lifted or inspired by the Batman mythos. The series also introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/harley-quinn\/4005-1696\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1696\">Harley Quinn<\/a> and Renee Montoya to the Batman mythos. Soon after <em>Batman the Animated Series<\/em> ended, Batman appeared (once again) in a guest spot for <em>Superman: The Animated Series<\/em> before starring in his own show, titled <em>The New Batman Adventures.<\/em> In these adventures, Batman, along with many other characters, featured a new costume design, many of which were recast including Batgirl who was elevated into Batman's partner. Dick Grayson left Gotham and soon used his Nightwing identity that was displayed in the comics. A new Robin came in the form of Tim Drake (who had Jason Todd's origin story). These new revamped episodes not only showed Batman fighting the same villains but new ones as well some created for the show itself.<\/p><p>Before the scenes in <em><a href=\"\/batman-beyond-return-of-the-joker\/4025-128\/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-128\">Return of the Joker<\/a>,<\/em> Batman was shown having many adventures with the Justice League involved in the creation of that team offering his own money and service but preferring to stay a reserve member. That did not stop him from developing friendships with Superman, Flash, Hawkgirl, and Wonder Woman, whom it is implied that he shared a romantic attraction. Over the series, Batman would often be one of the critical members and often serve as a way to solve a problem showing his importance. Though <em>Justice League<\/em> is that last produced series in the DCAU, it chronologically takes place before <em>Batman Beyond.<\/em><\/p><h4><a href=\"\/batman-beyond\/4075-116\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-116\">Batman Beyond<\/a><\/h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-445848\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14751\/445848-mantle.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14751\/445848-mantle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-445848\"><img alt=\"An old Bruce with Terry McGinnis\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14751\/445848-mantle.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14751\/445848-mantle.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/14751\/445848-mantle.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14751\/445848-mantle.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"An old Bruce with Terry McGinnis\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14751\/445848-mantle.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14751\/445848-mantle.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/14751\/445848-mantle.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14751\/445848-mantle.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>An old Bruce with Terry McGinnis<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/batman-beyond\/4075-116\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-116\"><em>Batman Beyond<\/em><\/a> is a continuation of Batman's legacy.

The series was not connected to Batman: The Animated Series or the DCAU. The character designs were by Jeff Matsuda, who drew the character designs for Jackie Chan Adventures and an aborted Spider-Man series. The series was not as dark or gritty as Batman: The Animated Series, and it did not receive as much praise; the series, however, was successful.<\/p><h4>Batman: The Brave and the Bold<\/h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1122382\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1122382\"><img alt=\"The Brave and the Bold\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Brave and the Bold\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/40\/1122382-579a063.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Brave and the Bold<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/batman-the-brave-and-the-bold\/4075-109\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-109\">Batman: The Brave and the Bold<\/a> was aimed at young children and were not as dark as the previous Batman shows.

Bruce later asks Dick to fill in for him briefly as he recovers from his back injury.<\/p><h2>Major Story Arcs<\/h2><h3>Prodigal<\/h3><p>Following the events of <a href=\"\/knightfall\/4045-40761\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40761\">Knightfall<\/a>, Bruce realizes the mistake he had made, and leaves the mantle of Batman to Dick as he finishes rebuilding his skills to become Batman.

With Robin already having a successful solo series, the powers-that-be decided to test the waters with <a href=\"..\/..\/nightwing\/49-5514\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightwing<\/a>. In 1995, DC launched a 4-issue Nightwing mini-series starring the former Boy Wonder. Written by <a href=\"..\/..\/dennis-oneil\/26-40861\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dennis O\u2019Neil<\/a> with art by <a href=\"..\/..\/greg-land\/26-2064\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greg Land<\/a>, the mini was a sales hit. When DC awarded Nightwing an <a href=\"..\/..\/nightwing-vol-2\/49-5755\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ongoing series<\/a> in 1996, they enlisted writer <a href=\"..\/..\/chuck-dixon\/26-41486\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chuck Dixon<\/a> and artist <a href=\"..\/..\/scott-mcdaniel\/26-2218\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scott McDaniel<\/a>. Dixon immediately set Nightwing apart from his mentor by giving him his own city: the corrupt, decaying harbor town known as <a href=\"..\/..\/bludhaven\/34-55771\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bl\u00fc<\/a><a href=\"..\/..\/bludhaven\/34-55771\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dhaven<\/a>, which lay just north of Gotham. It allowed him to be close enough to Gotham to stay part of the Batman Family, as well as have his own city and series of adventures. Visually, McDaniel\u2019s kinetic art was a perfect vehicle to convey Dick Grayson\u2019s acrobatic prowess.<\/p><h3>Bl\u00fcdhaven<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/196531-173026-nightwing.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-196531\" data-ratio=\"1.455\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/196531-173026-nightwing.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-196531\"><img alt=\"A savior arrives.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/196531-173026-nightwing.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/196531-173026-nightwing.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A savior arrives.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/196531-173026-nightwing.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/196531-173026-nightwing.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A savior arrives.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Dick Grayson decides that he should leave Gotham and move to <a href=\"..\/..\/bludhaven\/34-55771\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bl\u00fcdhaven<\/a> when he finds that twenty-two dead men have floated into Gotham's south harbor. Nightwing decides to move to the city and quickly sees that Bl\u00fcdhaven is what <a href=\"..\/..\/gotham-city\/34-23611\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gotham<\/a> was before Batman arrived, brimming with corruption to the highest levels of power. It seemed to be that whatever was too coarse or too awful for Gotham, would end up there. He quickly finds that all the corruption in the city leads directly to the crime lord Blockbuster. Now living in Bl\u00fcdhaven, Dick rents an apartment as a base of operations, as well as taking a job as a bartender in order to better keep track of both the crime and corruption in the city. Dick frequently battles Blockbuster's minions following putting a large bounty on Nightwing, attracting the attention of Dick's most reoccurring enemies, <a href=\"\/stallion\/4005-6868\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6868\">Stallion<\/a>, <a href=\"\/lady-vic\/4005-6867\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6867\">Lady Vic<\/a>, <a href=\"\/brutale\/4005-6863\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6863\">Brutale<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/shrike\/4005-6861\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6861\">Shrike<\/a>, all who attempt to claim the bounty.<\/p><p>After several months of being alone in Bl\u00fcdhaven, he begins training another enthusiastic young man named Nite-Wing who is determined to make a difference, but his brutal methods soon lead him to unknowingly murder an undercover FBI agent, with Nightwing defeating him and sending him to jail shortly afterwards.

Dick manages to climb up to the top, and is patched up by Alfred as he and Robin leave for Paris to stop Ra's plague from being released.

Arsenal asks Nightwing if he would like to join, but the latter refuses to join a team of any kind, for the same reason that he disbanded the Titans. Reluctantly, due to an emergency, the team goes on their first mission prematurely and Nightwing eventually agrees to join the team, which consists of <a href=\"\/jade\/4005-3406\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3406\">Jade<\/a>, <a href=\"\/shift\/4005-3409\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3409\">Shift<\/a>, <a href=\"\/thunder\/4005-3407\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3407\">Thunder<\/a>, <a href=\"\/grace-choi\/4005-3405\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3405\">Grace<\/a> and <a href=\"\/indigo\/4005-3408\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3408\">Indigo<\/a>.

It also symbolized not only that they were apart from the Superhero community, but that they had a need to be somewhat 'apart' from each other, so that the team would work less like a family, similar to how the Titans did, since Roy Harper thought that this would lead to a much more efficient team.<\/p><p>During his time as the leader of the Outsiders, Nightwing becomes very aggressive, cold and violent somewhat due to the fact that he wanted the team to work less like a family as he didn't want to 'care' for his teammates. In the Outsiders, he treats his teammates like soldiers, not seeming to care what happens to them. This eventually culminated in Jade, in response to the poor leadership Nightwing was showing as leader of the <a href=\"..\/..\/outsiders\/65-5704\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outsiders,<\/a> which was the reason that some teammates had been injured, decides to take the leadership role upon herself.

Starfire is able to stop the menace when Nightwing urges her not to hold back, with Starfire going Nova severely injuring Indigo, with Shift dealing the final blow by using his powers to turn her body into flesh.

Tarantula who arrives shortly after this, promptly aims her gun at Blockbuster during which Grayson chooses not to stop her, following which she shoots and kills Blockbuster. Nightwing, who feels guilty for not saving him and having violated his no kill policy, retreats to the roof where he begins having an emotional breakdown, Tarantula follows him and sexually forces herself on the nearly catatonic Grayson.<\/p><h3>War Games<\/h3><p>When a failed plan by <a href=\"..\/..\/stephanie-brown\/29-6156\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spoiler<\/a> results in a <a href=\"..\/..\/war-games\/39-42226\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">gang war<\/a> in Gotham, Batman asks all his allies, including Nightwing to help him stop this bloodshed.

However, Nightwing still suffers from guilt and depression for not saving Blockbuster's life, which he struggles to keep from Batman to avoid his disappointment for failing to live by his code. Nightwing is part of the back up for Batman when he believes \"<a href=\"\/orpheus\/4005-3728\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3728\">Orpheus<\/a>\" is finally taking control of the gangs, by herding them all into the Robinson Park Amphitheatre holding the line with the G.C.P.D. who under Batman orders are preparing to arrest all participants. However Batman miscalculates, as \"Orpheus\" is revealed to be Black Mask who orders all present to attack Batman, forcing Dick, Robin, Batgirl, and Onyx to abandon the G.C.P.D. to aid Batman, which leads to the police taking heavy casualties from the gang members, as well as prompting Commissioner Atkins to decree a shoot on sight order of vigilantes. After defeating the criminals inside the theatre, Batman then charges Nightwing to secure everything west of Robinson Park.<\/p><p>During this endeavor he runs across Gotham super villain <a href=\"\/firefly\/4005-3733\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3733\">Firefly<\/a>, beating him savagely for the deaths he cause at Haly's Circus, until being shot by two G.C.P.D. officers, where he manages to escape warning the others before passing out on a fire escape.

In this version, Robin is fired after a confrontation against <a href=\"..\/..\/clayface\/29-9589\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clayface<\/a>. Batman was worried that because Robin was attending to business with the Titans, he wasn't protecting Gotham as he did before. After a long verbal fight, Batman fires Robin. Dick Grayson leaves a newly made Robin costume in the Batcave and leaves the Wayne Manor.<\/p><p>Trying to figure out what to do with his life, Dick goes to visit Clark Kent (Superman). While visiting, they stop a terrorist attempt. After, this Superman takes Dick to the <a href=\"..\/..\/fortress-of-solitude\/34-41185\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fortress of Solitude<\/a> and tells him a history of a Kryptonian hero called Nightwing,who was cast out of his family and sought to prove he was better then any of them gave them credit for,a story that Dick felt he could relate to.<\/p><p>Dick then goes back to his roots in the circus where he and his parents worked when he was a child. There he meets <a href=\"..\/..\/deadman\/29-5690\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deadman<\/a> and creates a prototype version of his costume and his wing-dings. He then returns Gotham and introduces his new identity to <a href=\"..\/..\/james-gordon\/29-3727\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Commissioner Gordon<\/a>. He then sets out to foil a petty crime, during which he runs into Batgirl, and the two share an intimate moment, before Barbara stops it from happening,as Dick is with Starfire.<\/p><p>Shortly after this, <a href=\"..\/..\/jason-todd\/29-6849\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jason Todd<\/a> is introduced as the boy who will replace Dick as Robin. Bruce and Alfred set up a \"Gauntlet Test\" for Jason. Alfred dresses up as <a href=\"..\/..\/two-face\/29-5555\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Two-Face<\/a>, and Bruce dresses up as one of Two-Face's thugs. While on their way to meet up with Jason, two of <a href=\"..\/..\/killer-croc\/29-3725\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Killer Croc's<\/a> cronies discover the false Two-Face; they ram their car into Bruce and Alfred's car. They take Alfred hostage and shoot Bruce in the chest with a shotgun,which most of which is stopped by his costume he wore underneath, but leaves him incapacitated.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, Jason and <a href=\"\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson<\/a> run into each other. Jason mistakenly thinks that fighting the first Robin is his gauntlet test. Jason and Dick begin to fight when Bruce contacts Jason on his comm-link and tells them that <a href=\"..\/..\/alfred\/29-5556\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alfred<\/a> has been kidnapped and is being held at Gotham's Estuary. Dick and Jason go to the warehouse where Alfred is being kept and the two take out <a href=\"\/killer-croc\/4005-3725\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3725\">Killer Croc<\/a> together.

When Bruce and Tim ask him to travel abroad and retrain, however, Barbara urges him to go, requesting he return his engagement ring so he wouldn't be hesitant to go.

One of these changes is that Dick Grayson moves back to New York where he previously fought crime alongside the New Teen Titans.<\/p><p>There, he forms a sexual relationship with <a href=\"..\/..\/cheyenne-freemont\/29-49105\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cheyenne Freemont<\/a>. He also discovers that there is another Nightwing in New York. However, this one doesn't shy away from killing criminals. Because of this impostor's acts, Nightwing is seen as the most dangerous criminal in New York. Dick decides to look for the other Nightwing and find out who he really is, but before he can do that, he is attacked by two meta-humans, the Pierce Brothers.<\/p><p>Nightwing is caught by surprise and is defeated by one of the brothers. Luckily, he is rescued by the other Nightwing, who is revealed to be Jason Todd. The two Nightwings battle, and Jason wins after injuring Dick's hand. The two of them battle once again when they both try to stop a crime that involves stealing a lot of electronics to be sold by the Pierce Brothers.<\/p><p>That fight is recorded by a security camera, and the Pierce Brothers obtain the tape. They ask their employee \"Jakob\" who was the real Nightwing. He tells them that the real Nightwing prefers prudence and restraint, not the one that tends toward recklessness and lack of forethought. Jakob also reveals that the reason that Jason appears to have won because Dick was holding back. Dick later decides to visit his friend <a href=\"..\/..\/bridget-clancy\/29-6862\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clancy<\/a> (who had also moved to New York) and ask her about Jason's mental problems. She reminds Dick that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and tells him that the reason Jason probably uses the same codename and costume as Dick because he probably idolizes him as his hero.<\/p><p>A conversation with Cheyenne Freemont reveals her as another meta-human. Later, she discovers by accident that Dick Grayson is Nightwing and begins following him. Eventually, Jason is captured by Jakob. Dick and Cheyenne (also going by the name Nightwing) go to rescue him. Cheyenne kills Jakob in self-defense and they are confronted by the Pierce brothers. After a hard battle, the team-up of the two \"Nightwings\" are able to defeat the Pierce brothers and save <a href=\"\/jason-todd\/4005-6849\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Jason Todd<\/a>.<\/p><p>In a strange twist, Jason takes on properties previously displayed by Jakob and fights in a monstrous octopus form. In the end of the story arc, Jason leaves a note to Dick saying that he still considers him family, that he has left the costume and that he\u2019s back to normal. Cheyenne also abandons the name of Nightwing, leaving the one true Nightwing as protector of New York City.<\/p><h3>Raptor<\/h3><p>Nightwing eventually faces off against Raptor. Raptor is a human in a iron suit who is committing various crimes in the area. Eventually, though growing close to Raptor\u2019s family, Nightwing defeats Raptor.<\/p><h3>Nightwing leaves the Outsiders<\/h3><p>After giving <a href=\"..\/..\/batman\/29-1699\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman<\/a> the leader position, Dick auditions for the Outsiders team with both old members and possible newcomers. In the first one, he partners up with <a href=\"..\/..\/captain-boomerang\/29-7650\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain Boomerang Jr<\/a> in a space station taken by <a href=\"\/chemo\/4005-10004\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10004\">Chemo<\/a>.

Afterwards, Dick confronts Bruce about making the Outsiders members audition for a job they already had. Nightwing leaves the team, after an argument with his former mentor. Feeling that he has not done what he should have and what Dick was expecting from him when he handed over the leadership, Batman feels that this is for the best. Considering Dick is too good and kind-hearted of a person, which directly contradicts with what Batman intends for the <a href=\"..\/..\/outsiders\/65-5704\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outsiders<\/a> to be.<\/p><h3>The Lost Year<\/h3><p>After confronting Bride and Groom, Nightwing would be visited by a girlfriend from the past known as <a href=\"\/liu\/4005-46957\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46957\">Liu<\/a> after she is kidnapped by a gang named the Tigers. It is revealed that Dick Grayson (Nightwing) met Liu when he was seventeen a few months after the original Teen Titans had disbanded and a few days after a big fight with Batman.<\/p><h3>Return of Ra's Al Ghul<\/h3><p>After Ra\u2019s Al Ghul returns to Arkham, he offers Tim the ability to bring his parents back to life if he swears loyalty to Ra\u2019s instead of Batman. Having seen the horrors of the pit himself, Dick goes to stop Tim before he makes a mistake. Dick realizes Tim needs to stop it on his own, because Tim will resent him if he uses force to stop him. Tim eventually realizes his mistake, and they team up to battle Ra\u2019s league of Assassins.<\/p><h3>Free Fall<\/h3><p>Nightwing set up a headquarters in New York with the <a href=\"..\/..\/justice-society-of-america\/65-27589\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice Society Of America<\/a> helping him.

The bat family and their allies do their best to put out the fires by setting up the Network to counter the violence. Robin and Squire tracked a group of robbers but before they could take them down some else does, Robin and Squire do not see the person but he leaves a note saying \" I AM BATMAN\". Dick eventually enters the imposters lair, following Tim Drake wearing a old Batman costume, following Dick's refusal to don the mantle. Dick was preoccupied with saving Damian Wayne from the Hands of Poison Ivy and Killer Croc when Tim was ambushed by Jason Todd in the lair. Grayson then battles Jason Todd defeating him and taking up the mantle of Batman.

He does this without consulting Tim Drake, who was Robin up until this point. Dick views Tim as his equal and, so he couldn't have him work under him. Before they can fully discuss things, Damian shows up causing a fight, which leads Tim to walk out on Dick.<\/p><p>Another important decision Dick makes is to leave the Batcave because that doesn't fit his style. He creates a bunker beneath Wayne Tower, their new base of operations. While crusading as Batman, Dick has to deal with Damian Wayne's anger, Huntress (Helena Bertinelli) wanting to get back together, and new\/old villains.<\/p><h3>Blackest Night<\/h3><p>In this crossover event, Dick and Damian try to control Gotham's panic. They go to the grave of the unmarked Bruce Wayne, to find the grave ransacked. They also find out that Thomas &amp; Martha Wayne's bones have been stolen.<\/p><h3>Flashpoint<\/h3><p>In this legendary crossover, we see Dick Grayson with his parents in the Flying Graysons' trapeze act. In this world, they are part of a traveling circus trying to avoid the world-crippling war between the Amazonians and the Atlanteans. Little did they know that one of their acts \"Helm of Fate\" featured an Amazonian artifact known to the Amazonians as the <a href=\"\/helmet-of-fate\/4055-56063\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56063\">Helm of Nabu.<\/a> The Amazonians attack, during this assault they kill both of Dick's parents, Boston Brand (Deadman), and Kent Nelson (Doctor Fate) these events inspire Dick to put on the Helm of Fate and becomes the new <a href=\"\/doctor-fate-nelson\/4005-5898\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5898\">Doctor Fate<\/a>. As Doctor Fate, Dick joins the growing resistance to the war.<\/p><h3>The Search for Bruce Wayne<\/h3><p>Dick believes that Bruce is stuck in time, following his sticking the body he believed to be Bruce's in a Lazarus Pit and learning it was a clone. <a href=\"..\/..\/talia\/29-4917\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talia Al Ghul Wayne<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-hurt\/29-54826\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Hurt<\/a>, and others are intent on killing Dick Grayson. Talia is the first, seeing that Dick wasn't worthy enough to be Batman and his influence on her son Damian. She promptly uses a neural implant in Damian's spine to allow Deathstroke to control the boy, however Dick shorts out the implant and attacks Deathstroke in his hospital bed saying it was just a preview of things to come.<\/p><h3>Batman &amp; Robin must Die!<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2165837\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101435\/2165837-bmrob_cv1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.541095890411\" data-width=\"584\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 584px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101435\/2165837-bmrob_cv1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2165837\"><img alt=\"Batman &amp; Robin\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px\" data-width=\"415\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101435\/2165837-bmrob_cv1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101435\/2165837-bmrob_cv1.jpg 584w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101435\/2165837-bmrob_cv1.jpg 415w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Batman &amp; Robin\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101435\/2165837-bmrob_cv1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101435\/2165837-bmrob_cv1.jpg 584w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101435\/2165837-bmrob_cv1.jpg 415w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px\" data-width=\"415\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Batman &amp; Robin<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When Bruce returns from the events of <a href=\"..\/..\/batman-return-of-bruce-wayne\/39-56130\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Return of Bruce Wayne<\/a> he quickly heard the news (from Tim Drake) about Dick and Damian having trouble with the Joker and Dr. Hurt. While Bruce confronts Dr. Hurt, Dick and Damian has to stop the massive crowd that was causing chaos in Gotham City. Dick is badly wounded by a gunshot in the head. Eventually Dr. Hurt is bested and buried alive. Bruce Wayne publicly announces that he was giving Batman money to build his equipment and vehicles. Bruce did this because he needed to keep his secret identity a secret. Bruce in the end, announced that Batman INC will go worldwide, and Batman will be the Watcher of the world.<\/p><h3>Eye of the Beholder<\/h3><p>Bruce Wayne has returned and now keeping Gotham safe is now Dick's responsibility while Bruce Wayne goes international with Batman Inc.<\/p><h3>Black Mirror<\/h3><p>Shortly after <a href=\"..\/..\/batman\/29-1699\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bruce Wayne<\/a> appointed <a href=\"\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson<\/a> to be the Batman of <a href=\"..\/..\/gotham-city\/34-23611\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gotham City<\/a>, a string of mysterious crimes occur involving weapons from the cast of Batman's rogue gallery. Grayson soon finds out that there is a secret auction called the Mirror House, led by a man called the Dealer who sells weapons and items used by many different villains to the highest bidder. Dick disguises himself as a guest and infiltrates the Mirror House where the Dealer auctions <a href=\"..\/..\/crowbar\/18-56524\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Crowbar<\/a> used in the vicious beating of <a href=\"..\/..\/jason-todd\/29-6849\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jason Todd<\/a> at the hands of the <a href=\"..\/..\/joker\/29-1702\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joker<\/a> many years ago. Dick's cover is eventually blown and he is exposed to a gas that causes him to hallucinate while being attacked by the crazed members of the Mirror House. He manages to escape, and after recovering from the brutal attack, goes to take down the Dealer but the villain manages to escape. In the end, Dick recollects how he never expected that kind of viciousness from the citizenry of Gotham and he feels that the city is getting meaner and wilder.<\/p><h3>Skeleton Keys<\/h3><p>As <a href=\"\/james-gordon\/4005-3727\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">Gordon<\/a> tries to draw a line between work and home, he gets a phone call from Harvey Bullock telling him to go to the Gotham City Aviary. When Gordon arrives, <a href=\"\/harvey-bullock\/4005-5554\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5554\">Bullock<\/a> informs Jim that the aviary cages are all automated from the control room and there is some troubling video footage from the security cameras that Jim needs to see. Gordon sees the image of a man who resembles his son <a href=\"..\/..\/james-gordon-jr\/29-70633\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">James Jr.<\/a> This troubling assumption begins to trouble Gordon and soon he becomes haunted by the visions of past unsolved case files that involved murdered children.<\/p><p>Fifteen years ago, Gordon was moving up the ranks within the precinct when he started investigating a string of eight murders that involved the Peter Pan Killer who would sneak into family homes and abduct children from their beds then murder them. Gordon apprehended the Peter Pan Killer when he attempted to abduct a young James Jr.<\/p><p>Now after 15 years, Gordon heads to Blackgate to interrogate the Peter Pan Killer before he was released from prison. Gordon wanted to find out why the killer didn\u2019t go through with kidnapping James Jr. The killer reveals that he was going to kill Gordon Jr. rather than abducting him because James Jr. gave the killer an ominous stare when he entered the boy\u2019s room. The killer also reveals that he murdered a young girl who was friends with <a href=\"\/barbara-gordon\/4005-5368\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Oracle<\/a> before he visited Gordon\u2019s apartment.<\/p><p>This revelation causes Gordon wonder about his son\u2019s innocence and what exactly happened to the young girl. Oracle has always been under the assumption that James Jr. murdered her friend Bess because she saw James Jr. playing with her friend\u2019s apartment keys with smug look on his face. Gordon has heard this story from Babs before but now he doubts if Babs\u2019 story is actually true. There is a possibility that the killer took the young girl\u2019s keys and dropped them at the Gordon\u2019s apartment by accident. After his conversation with the Peter Pan Killer, Gordon threatens the killer that he will be followed at all times in order to prevent another murder.<\/p><p>Later on that same day, Gordon invites Oracle for some coffee at Bay Diner and talks to her about his findings. Jim tells Barbara that her brother, <a href=\"..\/..\/james-gordon-jr\/29-70633\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">James Jr.<\/a>, is back in Gotham City. Barbara asks her father if he really thinks it's him coming back, and Jim replies yes. As they continue their talk, Barbara reminds her father that Jim Jr. is really smart and cunning. Jim tells her that it's going to be all right and that they've got police officers looking out for him. Oracle still sticks by her story and she leaves her father with lingering doubts but then James Jr. appears from other side of the diner, staring at his father. James Jr. sits down with his father and explains his return to Gotham. James Jr. begins by apologizing to his father for the theatrics at the aviary. James tells the commissioner that his mother (Barbara Sr.) sent him to <a href=\"\/arkham-asylum\/4020-31682\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31682\">Arkham<\/a> for a psychological evaluation and the doctors clinically diagnosed him as mentally unstable in regards to exhibiting apathetic behavior. However, the doctors prescribed an experimental medicine to help James in stabilizing his emotional imbalance.<\/p><p>James also overheard Oracle's convictions about him and he swears to his father that he has never killed anybody. Gordon still doesn't know what to think about his son until James informs him about his volunteer work at Dr. Thompkins' clinic. James Jr. leaves the cafe and asks that his father will hopefully find it in his heart to forgive him. For a while, Gordon feels this extreme sense of relief that his son is misunderstood but he is changing for the better. When Gordon reaches his apartment, he finds a trail of blood. Gordon follows the trail to James Jr.'s old room. The trail ends in James' closet. Gordon opens the door and finds the body of a schoolyard bully that James Jr. fell victim to when he was young.<\/p><p>It seems everyone was right about James Jr. even though Gordon tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Gordon immediately goes to the clinic and finds <a href=\"\/leslie-thompkins\/4005-3740\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3740\">Dr. Thompkins<\/a>. Gordon confronts Leslie by demanding to know where his son is. Leslie informs Gordon that his son is a model volunteer because anything she asks him to do, he \"happily\" does. Over time, Leslie has given James Jr. more responsibilities like making \"nutrition runs\" for newborn babies who come from poor families. Gordon doesn't want to panic Leslie by telling her what he had found at his apartment so he humbly asks her to call him the moment James comes in for his shift. Leslie agrees to Gordon's request and she tries to calm his worries by showing him James' office.<\/p><p>Leslie flips on the lights in James' office and gives Gordon a tour. As Leslie professes how great James is, Gordon on the other hand, can't believe that Leslie would be so naive to willingly put her full trust in someone like James. Gordon peers around the office and finds a vile of James' medicine. The medicine is called Diaxemene which is designed to release a chemical in the brain so the patient can feel empathy. Gordon takes a pill from the vile, thanks Leslie for the tour and makes his way to Barbara's place at Kord Tower.<\/p><p>Gordon gives <a href=\"\/barbara-gordon\/4005-5368\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Barbara<\/a> the pill that he took from James' office and asks her to run a couple of tests. Barbara knew something was going on with James but she didn't want to rub in her father's face because she could see that Gordon still wanted to hold onto any hope of saving his son. Barbara figures the medicine is supposed to help James in treating or possibly curing his psychotic tendencies but Diaxemene is still in the testing phases and hasn't been approved by the FDA. Gordon is hoping he can convince James to undergo some blood work in order to make sure that he has been taking his pills.<\/p><p>Gordon leaves Barbara to her work while he heads back to the clinic. Barbara breaks down the pill's components and she makes a startling discovery. James has reversed the effect of the pill and now the pill is designed to chemically induce apathy rather than empathy in a certain section of the brain. However, the dosage of James' pill is of such low grade that it wouldn't affect an adult. Barbara relays all of her findings to Gordon's cell phone. Gordon can't understand why James would concoct a pill with such a low dosage then it hits him. Leslie made James responsible for the \"nutrition runs\" at her clinic. James has been putting his pills in the baby formula and giving it to all the newborns thereby ensuring their development into becoming psychopaths.<\/p><p>Just as Gordon reached the clinic, he is stopped by Det. Bullock who has some really bad news. Bullock says the Joker has escaped Arkham and something horrible has happened to Gordon's ex-wife. Gordon acts quickly by warning Leslie about James then he calls in a small task force to station themselves at the clinic and wait for James to return. Gordon must put the hunt for his deranged son in the hands of his brothers in blue while he accompanies Bullock. Bullock tells Gordon that he received an anonymous phone call from someone who said Barbara Gordon is going to die at the Gotham Plaza Hotel. Gordon and Bullock reach the hotel room where Barbara was staying at and as Gordon entered, he notices a light coming from the bathroom. Gordon falls to his knees in tears because he has found his beloved ex-wife nude in the bath tub with a crimson smile across her face.<\/p><p>Gordon rushes Barbara to the lab at <a href=\"\/wayne-enterprises\/4020-56461\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56461\">Wayne Enterprises<\/a> while Bullock calls in Oracle and tells her what has just happened. Oracle reacts by calling Dick and having him meet her father at the lab. Oracle runs a few tests on her mother while Dick injects the anti-Joker Venom. Fortunately, Gordon got to Barbara just in time to save her and the Joker Venom was a derivative of the original. Gordon at this point wants Joker's head on a pike for all the misery he has brought to the Gordons, but Dick convinces Gordon that there is no way the Joker could have escaped Arkham and found out where Barbara was so quickly. Dick promises Gordon that he will find Joker and make him talk.<\/p><p>Dick heads to Arkham and conducts a complete sweep of the crime scene. From what Dick could deduce, <a href=\"\/joker\/4005-1702\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker<\/a> didn't get very far from Arkham because Dick begins follow a trail of Joker's sweat which seems to be secreting Joker Venom. Dick follows the trail to an abandoned section of Arkham. At this point, Dick figures that Joker must have discovered Victor Zsasz's underground path which leads to the catacombs beneath Arkham. <a href=\"\/mr-zsasz\/4005-25091\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25091\">Zsasz<\/a> used this path to escape Arkham so he could freely kill anyone he wanted in Gotham then he would make his way back to Arkham as if he had never escaped at all.<\/p><p>Dick finds Joker in a dank corner of the catacombs. He notices Joker mumbling to himself about being disappointed. Dick apprehends Joker and begins to interrogate him. Joker starts off by complaining about the fact that Dick isn't the real Batman by saying \"You don't scare me little bird\u201d and he isn't saying a word until the real Batman returns. Dick decides to beat down on the Joker until he reveals who he hired to attack Barbara Gordon. Joker laughs hysterically because according to him, the real Batman would have figured out that the Joker does his own dirty work and he would never send some errand boy to take credit for his fun. Dick finally realizes that the Joker was able to escape simply because someone needed him to be the scapegoat for the attack on Barbara Gordon and they were counting on Commissioner Gordon to retaliate by ending the Joker once and for all.<\/p><p>Back at the lab, Gordon sat by Barbara's side as Bullock escorted Oracle back to her apartment. Barbara eventually wakes up and when she laid her eyes on Gordon, she immediately began to scream for help. A doctor comes rushing and injects a sedative into Barbara. Gordon finally realizes that James injected the Joker Venom into his mother as a way to get back at her for institutionalizing him while at the same time he wanted Gordon to think the Joker was responsible for the attack on Barbara in order to bait him into killing the Joker. If Gordon knows how calculating his son can be then he would guess that James has already realized his plan to manipulate everything is falling apart which leaves only one person left for him to torture...Oracle.<\/p><p>Bullock drops Oracle off at her apartment doorstep and just as she entered her apartment, James closes the door right behind her. James and Oracle enter a discussion about on how depraved he is. James respects Oracle because she is the only one who can see him for what he is. Barbara replies to his compliment with a scoff. Oracle always knew James was disturbed and most of those people that he has already killed were actually victims rather people who had it coming. In short, Oracle realizes that James tries to find flaws or start something with another person just so he can justify as well as satisfy his violent tendencies. James smiles and his respect for Oracle's deduction has reached new lengths.<\/p><h2>The New 52<\/h2><h3>Traps and Trapezes<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1845669\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14487\/1845669-ntw_cv1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5384615384615\" data-width=\"468\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 468px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14487\/1845669-ntw_cv1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1845669\"><img alt=\"Dick Grayson as Nightwing (New 52)\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14487\/1845669-ntw_cv1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14487\/1845669-ntw_cv1.jpg 468w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14487\/1845669-ntw_cv1.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dick Grayson as Nightwing (New 52)\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14487\/1845669-ntw_cv1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14487\/1845669-ntw_cv1.jpg 468w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/14487\/1845669-ntw_cv1.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dick Grayson as Nightwing (New 52)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After his tenure as Batman, Dick Grayson returns to his old mantle of Nightwing, in a new red in black suit, defending Old Gotham alongside Batman and the rest of the Bat Family.

Raya and the new catcher Marc pressure Dick into performing once again on the trapeze, which he does and impresses everyone in attendance.<\/p><p>On the way home from the circus, <a href=\"\/saiko\/4005-79618\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79618\">Saiko<\/a>, a mysterious assassin, attacks Dick Grayson and kills two police officers in the process. The assassins reveals that Dick Grayson \"is the fiercest killer in all of Gotham and he doesn't even know it\" which is surprising to the young hero. Nightwing gains the upper hand by delivering a 150-thousand-volt shock through the suit, knowing such Saiko decides to use a diversion of blowing up a car with passengers inside in order to get away. Nightwing saves the three passengers inside the car, but is unable to find Saiko.<\/p><p>When Dick finally gets back to his place, Raya is there already, telling him that she needs a ride to Atlantic City. On the flight, she reveals that C.C. Haly is dying. When they get to the storage shed of all the circus props, C.C. Haly gives Dick the deed to the circus, as well as an ominous message about his parents.<\/p><p>After a night of passion with Raya on the flight home, Saiko calls Dick on the flight, telling him that Haly has revealed Nightwing's secret identity, and that he has to turn around, or else C.C. Haly is going to die.<\/p><p>As Nightwing, Dick rushes over back to the storage shed, where he engages in round two. However, Dick is much more serious in this fight, with his only goal being to get C.C. Haly out of the burning building. However, it isn't enough. And C.C. Haly dies in Dick's arms, after telling him another ominous message about the \"answer's in the heart of the circus.\"<\/p><p>At the funeral, Dick is confronted by a drunk Bryan, who is upset that Dick is the one who received the deed for the circus. Raya later drops the bomb on Dick that <a href=\"\/feedback\/4005-80840\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80840\">Zane<\/a>, an old childhood friend, is a big crime boss in Chicago, and guilts him by saying he would have known that if they stayed in touch, but doesn't expect that he would of since \"[he's] the guy who didn't even come back for Raymond's Funeral.\"<\/p><p>Nightwing swings over to Zane's place and confronts him about the whole thing. Zane reveals that he has also been known as \"Feedback\", and has an implant, and uses it against Nightwing, which makes Dick confront his biggest insecurities, as well as the fear of losing his parents all over again. But Nightwing overcomes this, and inverts the signal, so Zane is forced to deal with the feedback himself. After Zane is defeated, he reveals that it wasn't him who killed Haly, or even knows who killed him, because \"if [he] knew, [he] would kill them.\"<\/p><p>Dick returns to the circus and tells Raya that he did actually go to Raymond's funeral, but couldn't muster up the guts to say anything to her when he was there. Raya, touched by this, brings Dick inside her room for another night of passion.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5429834\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128414\/5429834-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.20.03+pm.png\" data-ratio=\"1.5081967213115\" data-width=\"488\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 488px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128414\/5429834-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.20.03+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5429834\"><img alt=\"Nightwing and Batgirl\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111128414\/5429834-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.20.03+pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128414\/5429834-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.20.03+pm.png 488w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111128414\/5429834-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.20.03+pm.png 424w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Nightwing and Batgirl\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111128414\/5429834-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.20.03+pm.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128414\/5429834-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.20.03+pm.png 488w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111128414\/5429834-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.20.03+pm.png 424w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Nightwing and Batgirl<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After Dick stopped by while still in Gotham to check up on her, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/barbara-gordon\/4005-5368\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Barbara Gordon<\/a> stops by in hopes of getting help from Dick for a case she has been working on. However, she comes at the worst time, as Raya is still in Dick's room. Barbara teases Dick about this much to his annoyance. The two suit up and hit the town. The guy there after is a shapeshifter known as <a href=\"\/spinebender\/4005-81451\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81451\">Spinebender<\/a>, who has been stealing Q-Core's microchips from Gotham.<\/p><p>For the next three hours, the two have playful banter about Dick's love life and his Saiko case, so Nightwing decides to take a closer look at the crime scene.<\/p><p>But Spinebender is on to them, and tries to take out Batgirl while disguised as Nightwing. But Nightwing comes by in the nick of time, and saves her. The three of them scuffle, eventually bringing Asimov's men into the fight too. Nightwing defeats Spinebender by electrocuting him with his taser, which reacts with the silica within his body, freezing him in the process.<\/p><p>Dick and Babs part ways on a good note, with parting words that helps him solve the mystery about the \"heart of the circus.\" He learns that the heart of the circus is actually a place, which is under the big tent. Inside he finds a board that has more wear are tear than any of the other boards. He breaks it open and finds a book with names, one of which is his own.<\/p><p>While in New Orleans, Jimmy Clark, one of the circus performers, is kidnapped by the demon known as <a href=\"\/acheron\/4005-82172\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-82172\">Acheron<\/a>, for his master, Zohna. Luckily, Dick is there to try and save him, but he is quickly overpowered. Nightwing speeds off in a hurry, and stops the soul-binding ceremony. Nightwing defeats Acheron with his superior agility, and easily overpowered Zohna. At the end, it's revealed that Jimmy was actually supposed to marry this girl.<\/p><p>On one of the circus's stops in Texas, Nightwing goes off to confront Terrence Clark, someone who may know something about Saiko. But in order to get to him, he has to go through Shox. Nightwing easily defeats him by goading him into punching the glass under him, dropping him into water. Nightwing interrogates the man, and the only useful information given is the fact that Saiko used a burner phone.<\/p><p>Raya drops the bomb on Dick, about a Flying Grayson memorial show which will be held in Gotham City, on the anniversary of their deaths. However, Dick sees this as an opportunity for Saiko to strike, and thinks of it as a bad idea. The circus folks are less than pleased, with Bryan Haly calling him out, stating that \"[he] just [wants] the circus to die\", which isn't the case at all. But all this talks Dick into doing the show, but he isn't going to do it without properly protecting his family.<\/p><p>At the show, Dick gives a speech that touches Raya, but it distracts Dick from looking at the motion sensors, as Saiko is able to slip into the circus. The two men scuffle for a bit, until it is revealed that Saiko is none other than Raymond, talking about how he was tortured and ruined by a mysterious group. Raymond blows up the circus, blaming it all on Dick himself.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5429881\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128414\/5429881-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.42.50+pm.png\" data-ratio=\"0.60985626283368\" data-width=\"487\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 487px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128414\/5429881-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.42.50+pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5429881\"><img alt=\"Nightwing vs. Saiko\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111128414\/5429881-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.42.50+pm.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128414\/5429881-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.42.50+pm.png 487w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11112\/111128414\/5429881-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.42.50+pm.png 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111128414\/5429881-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.42.50+pm.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Nightwing vs. Saiko\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111128414\/5429881-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.42.50+pm.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11112\/111128414\/5429881-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.42.50+pm.png 487w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11112\/111128414\/5429881-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.42.50+pm.png 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11112\/111128414\/5429881-screen+shot+2016-09-11+at+12.42.50+pm.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Nightwing vs. Saiko<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The audience members try to escape the circus, as everything around them starts to blow up, but the doors are locked.<\/p><p>Raymond reveals that Haly staged his death, and gave him to this secret society, where they broke him, tortured him, but eventually ditched him, and tried to feed him to the birds.

Saiko reveals that Raya has been on his side the whole time, whispering things to Dick to edge him onto this path. However, Raya flips sides, and saves the audience members in attendance.

Bruce learns of this by taking a tissue sample of both of them. Dick is furious at Bruce, accusing him of being selfish. Bruce punches Dick in the face, revealing that he has a false tooth, which has the mark of the Talon, cementing the idea that Dick was supposed to be one of them. The two talk it out, with Dick reassuring Bruce that he doesn't care who is his ancestors were, or what they wanted him to be, what he was supposed to be, because he is the man he is today because it's the man he wanted to be, the kind of man Bruce raised him to be. After their discussion, Alfred informs Dick about a double homicide that involves one of his eskrima sticks.<\/p><h3>Night of the Owls<\/h3><p>Nightwing is in the GCPD evidence room, retrieving his eskrima stick that was involved in a double homicide, resulting in the death of the Strayhorn brothers.

Nightwing, being close to city hall, heads out to save Mayor Hady from the Talon.<\/p><p>By the time Nightwing gets there, however, all the guards are dead and Councilman David was beheaded in front of the deputy mayor and the mayor himself. Nightwing breaks through the window and begins to fight off the talon. After getting the two men into another room, he starts a swordfight with the talon, where Nightwing got the upper hand after jamming his sword through the chest of the talon, and sticking his eskrima stick in his eye.<\/p><p>Just when Nightwing thought it was over, William Cobb comes in, throwing multiple projectiles into Nightwing\u2019s chest, out to kill his own great grandson.<\/p><p>Nightwing tackles the Talon out the window, with him stumbling on a landing, and with Cobb landing directly on a car from multiple stories above.

Being a descendent of an original Talon from Gotham\u2019s Court of Owls, it gave the Parliament history and legacy.<\/p><p>Dick is tasked with being an enforcer for the Parliament, to take down targets who they deem to be wary of all around the world.

He always seems to attract or be attracted to various women throughout the DCU. One of the earliest known publications of Dick's interactions involve a relationship with <a href=\"..\/..\/flamebird\/29-3577\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flamebird<\/a>, but as things became more serious he ended things with her. Dick has also had a one night stand with the Huntress, who admits she only did it to gain entrance into the \"boys club.\"<\/p><p>While in Hudson University he had a romantic relationship with another student, <a href=\"..\/..\/lori-elton\/29-34726\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lori Elton<\/a>. During Bludhaven, he also began a relationship with his landlady Bridget Clancy, it however ended shortly after it began following the beginning of his relationship with Barbara Gordon.<\/p><p>Dick's most well known relationships however was with his fellow Teen Titan <a href=\"\/starfire\/4005-2389\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2389\">Starfire<\/a>, who was Grayson's first love for many years, progressing to the point of marriage, but the ceremony was interrupted by their teammate Raven. Since then the two have found comfort with each other multiple times, but Grayson recently let Starfire know that he was no longer in love with her.<\/p><p>Dick's most recent relationship was with <a href=\"\/barbara-gordon\/4005-5368\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Barbara Gordon<\/a>, with the two finally letting their feelings be known during the course of his Nightwing series, they progressed to the point that the two were to be married, but Dick's injury during Infinite Crisis changed the plans, with the two remaining extremely close friends. Kyle Higgins, the writer of the new series, released a statement concerning Barbara's relationship with Dick, claiming that they had never dated and did not have a currently romantic relationship, but that they were still close friends. Most recently, the two have interacted with Barbara reflecting on their relationship and how it has evolved over the years. The two had a friendly, yet brutal fight, where Barbara nearly let it slip the fact that she loved him, before she re-corrected herself and asked him to leave her alone while she worked a few things out. She later comes to visit him in Miami, where Haly's Circus was at the time. She apologizes for what happened between them and the two bond together after a night out, fighting <a href=\"\/spinebender\/4005-81451\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-81451\">Spinebender<\/a>. Barbara, unfortunately, realizes that Dick is spending his time with Raya and sees that she has no place in his life.<\/p><p>Dick also reignited some sort of relationship with <a href=\"\/raya-vestri\/4005-80320\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80320\">Raya Vestri<\/a>. The two have known each other during Dick's tenure with Haly's circus and they later reconnect on a more personal level on a flight from Atlantic City to Gotham where they end up having sex on a Wayne Enterprise jet. Later they are seen having a fling, but Raya reminds Dick that after the latter figures out what was the problem behind the death of C.C. Haly, that he would leave her and the two wouldn't have a chance to go back together.<\/p><h2>Relationship with the Batman Family<\/h2><h3>Tim and Dick<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4019938\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.55390625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4019938\"><img alt=\"From The New Titans #65\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"From The New Titans #65\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11116\/111164672\/4019938-3673665172-40190.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>From The New Titans #65<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Dick and <a href=\"\/tim-drake\/4005-9290\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Tim<\/a> share a brotherly bond and were close from the start, as Dick was the one who helped train him and the only person who supported Tim's decision to become Robin.

Furthermore, Dick performs feats of agility like these on a daily basis.<\/p><p>Not only is Dick agile, but his body is very flexible as he can perform feats such as, to use his flexibility and agility to maneuver around many cars after jumping from a moving train, and then get to the same place he was on the train.<\/p><h4>Peak Human Strength<\/h4><p>With his strength, Dick has thrown a refrigerator, broke through a bus window while underwater and thrown people through concrete walls. For example, his attacks are powerful enough to make <a href=\"\/blockbuster\/4005-8263\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8263\">Blockbuster<\/a> bleed and even knocking him off.<\/p><h4>Peak Human Endurance<\/h4><p>Nightwing was able to withstand punishment from the powerful demon Acheron and to recover quickly from it. When he was knocked away by a Superman clone he was able to recover quickly from the attack as well. He also withstood repeated attacks from Blockbuster despite being exhausted beforehand and not fighting back. Furthermore he can go without sleep for 4 straight days and hold his breath for 7 minutes.<\/p><h4>Genius Level Intellect<\/h4><p>Dick is highly intelligent and a master detective. He was officially mentioned as being the second to Batman in detective ability in the second volume of the <a href=\"\/the-dc-comics-encyclopedia\/4050-20244\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20244\">DC Comics Encyclopedia<\/a>.

His suit is made for his fighting style of \"move more get hit less\" and has less armor to facilitate this, though he can add armor when facing fast and strong foes. The suit is light sensitive, darkening when there is more light in the area. His mask included a built-in radio transmitter\/receiver and Starlite night-vision lenses. It has a computer link and analysis. The lens can zoom and magnify his vision. It also has electromagnetic vision, which includes thermal, sonar, and x-ray vision. He also wears ear dampeners in defense against sonic attacks. Each one of his gauntlets and boots contain eight compartments in which he can store items. He sometimes wears a utility belt They have built into them a self-destruct feature such as the ones in Batman's utility belt. Each gauntlet's sections contains a lot of equipment, such as sonic or smoke pellets, modified batarangs (Wing-Dings), knockout gas capsules, and throwable tracers. The right gauntlet also contains a 100,000-volt stun gun, and a air driven launcher that shoots darts.<\/p><p>His boot compartments carry important equipment such as flares, a rebreather, a mini-computer equipped with fax, modem, GPS and a mini-disk rewritable drive.

In his beginning days as Batman, he took so much protection off of his suit, so that he could be more agile like his previous Nightwing persona. One such modification was lightening of the cape which he felt was too heavy to move effectively. However, this eventually came back to him when he got drugged by Two-face. After the confrontation against Two-face, Dick added more of the protection material for the suit. His cowl includes a built in radio\/WiFi receiver, it also includes nightvision. On his Bat-gloves\/gauntlets, he has two Bat-spikes on his glove instead of three like Bruce's gloves. They are made with kevlar, so that bullets, knives, and other weapons don't cut his hands. Also on his Boots, he has them made with kevlar too.

When multiple (now old) Bruce Wayne villains are getting killed by a \"new\" Hush, Bruce Wayne sends in Terry McGinnis to investigate. Villain after villain, Terry and Bruce are finding out that Tom Eliot was really killed years ago when, Bruce was still Batman. When <a href=\"..\/..\/catwoman\/29-1698\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Catwoman Beyond<\/a> falls in the lines between Hush and Bruce, she ends up being tricked by the person she was hired by. Dick Grayson once worked with Bruce (before he retired), Dick was shot-up by the Joker, and Bruce called the ambulance and he was rushed to the hospital. After Alfred was saved (whom the Joker kidnapped), he went to the hospital to perform his surgical tactics. Dick Grayson had a bullet lodged into his spine and eventually gave up the mantle of Nightwing. In the events of issue four, Dick Grayson turns out to be the \"new\" Hush, whom was trying to kill all of the enemies of Terry McGinnis and eventually kill Bruce Wayne. It is revealed that it is not Dick Grayson but a failed clone of Dick Grayson part of Project Batman Beyond.<\/p><p>When Terry goes to meet Dick Grayson at his warehouse, Dick describes his final days as a Nightwing. It seems that Joker had kidnapped Alfred after learning things from his hostage Tim Drake. Joker had learned who Batman was and who is in his social circle. Joker shoots at Grayson causing him to lose one eye and suffer severe injuries. Grayson felt let down by Bruce because Bruce did not make the effort in comforting him when Dick needed him most but he bore no serious grudge since he understood Bruce's morbid character. Dick later revealed to the public of his former identity but he told them that Batman simply hired him as a employee so that his comrades identities also would not be revealed.<\/p><h3>Red Rain\/Earth-43<\/h3><p>On Earth-43, Bruce Wayne was bitten and turned into a vampire. However, having control over his body, he needed a partner. Knowing that Robin wouldn't willingly join Bruce's cause of ridding criminals as Bat-Vampire, he bit Dick Grayson and turned him into Vampire Robin. Having the control over his mind and body, Dick accepted who he was and joined Batman in his war against crime. Taking to the shadows, Robin is trying to struggle with controlling the hunger and also stop Gotham City from eating itself from the sin of crime.<\/p><h3>Amalgam Universe<\/h3><p>Nightwing and <a href=\"\/moon-knight\/4005-1493\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1493\">Moon Knight<\/a> are fused to create \"<a href=\"..\/..\/moonwing\/29-52406\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moonwing<\/a>\".

Another example is when Slade offers to be a father figure to Robin, to which he retorts by telling Slade that he already has a father and bats are seen flying up and out of Slade's stronghold.

When Bruce Wayne retires with Catwoman (<a href=\"..\/..\/catwoman\/29-1698\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Selina Kyle<\/a>) they eventually raise a son named, Damian Wayne. Unlike the cartoon, the comics state that <a href=\"..\/..\/talia\/29-4917\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talia Al Ghul<\/a> is the mother of Damian. When a new Clown Prince of Crime takes Gotham over with an iron fist, this new Joker might be to much for Dick to handle.

In this production, Dick wears the blue suit, minus the fingerstripes, much like the suit he wears in \"The New Batman Adventures.\" Nightwing is voiced by Jesse McCartney.<\/p><p>Robin is one of the founding members of the Young Justice and was originally attempting to become the leader, but because of his time working with Batman and the lack of vocal commands he passes the job to <a href=\"\/aqualad\/4005-71494\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71494\">Aqualad<\/a> who tells him once he is ready he will return the position to him. Dick continuity plays an important part for this team as the team's strategist and hacker. By the time Young Justice: Invasion begins, Dick Grayson had already assumed the mantle of Nightwing and became the leader of the Young Justice team. As Nightwing, Dick assumes command of the team filling the role once occupied by Batman however, unlike Batman, he also accompanied his teammates on missions like in the previous season. Dick's Nightwing costume is quite detailed incorporating black and grey like his mentor with the exception of a blue Nightwing crest branded across Dick's chest. Dick incorporates the use of escrima sticks in his combat more than in season 1.<\/p><p>Dick also takes a more serious approach to his combat during season 2 cutting down on wise cracks and taking down his opponents as swiftly as possible. Nightwing was one of the few members of the Young Justice team who knew that <a href=\"\/aqualad\/4005-71494\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71494\">Aqualad<\/a> and <a href=\"\/artemis\/4005-2359\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2359\">Artemis<\/a> were undercover within the Light to try and discover their secrets and their mysterious partner, The Reach. Dick juggles secrets that, in the wrong hands, could spell the end for the deep cover operatives. Dick guides the team through its bleakest days and manages to, \"stay whelmed\". as more teammates began to get captured by the Reach, Dick begins his detective work and discovers that Jaime Rayes (<a href=\"\/blue-beetle\/4005-4438\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4438\">Blue Beetle<\/a>) was under Reach control. With the help of his teammates, Dick formulates a counterattack which results in freeing Blue and Green Beetle from Reach control. Before their final assault on the Light, Dick relinquishes his command of the team and returns the post to Aqualad claiming he's, \"happy to get that monkey off his back\". Dick also joins Aqualad in crashing the Light's meeting with the Reach. Dick bears witness to Wally West's disappearance and takes the loss the hardest. After the final mission of the season, Dick tells Aqualad that he needs a break and needs time away from the team. He confidently reassures Aqualad that Batgirl would be able to fill his shoes while he's away.<\/p><h4>Teen Titans Go!<\/h4><p>Dick Grayson appears in Teen Titans go! as the leader of the team. Unlike the Teen Titans TV show that portrayed him as the calm serious leader, Dick is portrayed as power-hungry, a perfectionist, and a hot-head. He is often jealous of the other Titans powers because he has none. Dick is also shown to hear voices in his head and has feelings for Starfire. He also seems to be quite affectionate of his Bo Staff.<\/p><h4>Son of Batman<\/h4><p>Dick appears as Nightwing in the 2014 animated film Son of Batman voiced by Sean Maher. He first appears when preventing Damian from killing one of Deathstroke's men. He and Damian both square off with Dick managing to defeat Damian. Although Dick is reluctant to let Damian take up the Robin mantle, Damian takes the costume anyway.<\/p><h4>Batman vs. Robin<\/h4><p>Dick appears as Nightwingin the 2015 animated Batman vs. Robin, wich is a sequel to Son of Batman. Nightwing takes care of Damian while Batman is after the Court of Owls and later helps his mentor and Damian to fight Talon and his soldiers.<\/p><h4>Batman: Bad Blood<\/h4><p>After Batman apparently perishes in an explosion, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/alfred-pennyworth\/4005-5556\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5556\">Alfred Pennyworth<\/a> sends a distress signal to Nightwing.

Though Dick is not seen in the main storyline he is a playable character available to players\/users who have the DLC Nightwing bundle. In this game Dick uses electrically charged escrima sticks in combat as well as wing dings, wrist darts, and some other equipment.<\/p><p>A costume\/character skin based on Dick's look in \"New Batman Adventures\" is available for the this character.<\/p><h4>Injustice: Gods Among Us<\/h4><p>Nightwing is one of the playable fighters in this game. He is a gadget type fighter relying on his electrified escrima sticks which can combine into a staff and is voiced by Troy Baker. Nightwing's super move has him jump onto his motorcycle and repeatedly slash the opponent with electrified scallops on his gauntlets. Nightwing then jumps off of his motorcycle and slams his electrified bo staff into his opponent's chest. Nightwing currently has three skins to choose from. Nightwing has a default Injustice skin, a Regime (Damian) skin, and a New 52 skin. Pressing start when selecting Nightwing's New 52 skin turns the Nightwing crest blue instead red.<\/p><h4>Batman: Arkham Origins<\/h4><p>Dick's move-set has changed from his Nightwing Arkham City counter part. Dick uses Tim Drake's move-set from Arkham City incorporating the bo staff instead of his escrima sticks.<\/p><h4>Young Justice: Legacy<\/h4><p>Nightwing is a playable character in Young Justice Legacy and is voiced by Jesse MCcartney.<\/p><h2>Additional Info<\/h2><p>The relationship the Batman and Dick Grayson share is closer then another Boy Wonder or sidekick. \u201cThe Bat-Family\u201d as some may call it is filled with characters ranging from Alfred, the faithful butler, to Batgirl, the poor girl who went through hell because she was the daughter of a commissioner, but none of them seem to mean as much to Bruce as Dick. Without the Batman taking him under his nocturnal wings where would Richard Grayson be today? He would have never brought justice to those who have done him wrong and he wouldn\u2019t have become the strong man he is today. The Batman seems to consider Nightwing to be his son. Also Tim Drake, Damian Wayne, Cassandra Cain, and even Jason Todd look too Dick as a older brother. Dick and Jason especially seem to share a bond and a sibling rivalry of some sort possibly because they were the first two Robins and first two to eventually become their own man.<\/p><h3>A Near-Death Experience<\/h3><p>Originally the DC editors had decided that Dick Grayson would be killed in Infinite Crisis, while this decision was reversed they decided that if Dick was kept alive he would have to be changed.<\/p><h3>HeroClix<\/h3><p>In 2010 before Christmas they made a new set in Heroclixscalled DC 75TH it was all the DC Heroes they made in the set from the comic books series old and new stuff. Dick Grayson was made in the set as Batman and he came with a card with powers and his appearence as Batman in the new Batman and Robin series 2009-present. His point value as Batman is worth 77 points.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-111907\/","id":111907,"name":"Introducing Robin, The Boy Wonder","issue_number":"38"},"gender":1,"id":1691,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/6436334-nightwing%2039%20yasmine%20putri%20variant.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/6436334-nightwing%2039%20yasmine%20putri%20variant.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/6436334-nightwing%2039%20yasmine%20putri%20variant.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/6436334-nightwing%2039%20yasmine%20putri%20variant.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/6436334-nightwing%2039%20yasmine%20putri%20variant.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/6436334-nightwing%2039%20yasmine%20putri%20variant.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/6436334-nightwing%2039%20yasmine%20putri%20variant.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/6436334-nightwing%2039%20yasmine%20putri%20variant.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/original\/6436334-nightwing%2039%20yasmine%20putri%20variant.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Artwork,Images From Editing,Nightwing"},"name":"Dick Grayson","origin":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-4\/","id":4,"name":"Human"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-10\/","id":10,"name":"DC Comics"},"real_name":"Richard John Grayson-Wayne","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/","resource_type":"character"},{"aliases":"Commissioner Gordon\r\nJim Gordon\r\nBatman\r\nRookie","api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-3727\/","birth":"Jan 5, 1900","count_of_issue_appearances":3640,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:36","date_last_updated":"2017-08-18 02:45:14","deck":"James Gordon is one of Batman's first supporters, helping him fight against crime and corruption in Gotham City.

Jim did not like Batman\u2019s method of tracking down criminals and torturing them because it was going above the law. Eventually Batman was able to talk to Jim and they were able to set aside their differences and worked together to help rid crime in Gotham. Eventually Jim was able to succeed Commissioner Gorgan and become the police commissioner of GCPD. Jim deputized Batman and he became a law enforcer. Jim now frequently contacted Batman for help in solving crimes and to fight masked criminals.<\/p><h3><strong>Post-Crisis<\/strong><\/h3><p>After Crisis on Infinite Earths, James Gordon was re-introduced into the Batman word during <a href=\"\/frank-miller\/4040-7082\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7082\">Frank Miller<\/a>\u2019s run on Batman entitled \u201c <a href=\"\/batman-year-one\/4045-42224\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42224\">Batman: Year One<\/a>.\u201d James Gordon was a Special Forces veteran with hand-to-hand combat skills. He was also trained with all police weapons and marksmanship. Gordon was at the top of his league in Chicago.<\/p><p>He and his pregnant wife <a href=\"\/barbara-kean-gordon\/4005-70561\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70561\">Barbara<\/a> moved from <a href=\"\/chicago-illinois\/4020-55728\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55728\">Chicago<\/a> to <a href=\"\/gotham-city\/4020-23611\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City<\/a>. Jim was transferred to the corrupted Gotham City Police Department. Before meeting the Batman, Jim was involved in \"The Peter-Pan Killer\" case. The case revolved around a killer who would abduct children from their beds and murder them. When Gordon found out the chief suspect was released from prison, he followed the suspect in the hopes of preventing another murder. All the same, Jim remained the only honest cop in Gotham and soon finds out that his only ally against the criminal underworld was Batman. Batman was never deputized and Jim and Batman would make contact in private and away from the public eye. Whenever Jim needed to talk to Batman, he would use the <a href=\"\/bat-signal\/4055-55819\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55819\">Bat-Signal<\/a> that was placed on top of the GCPD building. Also at the end of the Year One story arc, Jim and his newly born son <a href=\"\/james-gordon-jr\/4005-70633\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70633\">James Gordon Jr.<\/a> were rescued by Batman without his mask on and seemingly appeared to have seen him as Bruce Wayne.

Jim quickly marries her but their relationship would take a turn. Essen questioned Jim why he needed Batman so much and this put strain on their marriage. However she was fatally shot and killed by the Joker. Jim had the Joker at point blank and was convinced by Batman to not kill the Joker. Instead, Jim shoots him in the leg in hopes of crippling him. The Joker got the joke that it was pay back for crippling Barbara and began to laugh uncontrollably. Since Batman had abandoned Gotham and then seemingly returned and acted as if nothing had happen, Jim lost all his trust in Batman. Batman intended to regain Jim\u2019s trust and decides that he would reveal his secret identity to Jim. Batman hoped that this would symbolize his trust for Jim by offering to reveal that he is Bruce Wayne. When Batman proceeds to take off his mask, Jim turns his back and replies that he does not want to know and demanded Batman put the mask back on.

He states that he has been back for about 3 months already and also mentions that he is back together with his ex-wife Barbara. During this time he rebuilds the Bat Signal which was not in use for the majority of the time Jim was not Commissioner. There has not been any clear cut reasoning for Jim coming out of Retirement, but allusions to serious corruption seem to be a good reason. Since his return he has been targeted by the Joker once again, this time being a victim of his Joker Venom, however he was brought to the Hospital in time. After the events of Batman R.I.P. Gordon seems to know that Batman is gone and makes not efforts to hide the fact that he knows. He appreciated the help of both Nightwing and Robin, to at one point making a Robin symbol, which is shut down soon after. He seems to know that there is a new Batman. He recognizes the voice but it is unclear if he believes Nightwing to be Batman. He often has moments with the new Batman that seem almost as though he's teaching this new Batman the way the old Batman operated. He comes under fire when the Gang War erupts between Penguin and Two Face and on top of that Arkham Asylum has been destroyed and rebuilt. He often has people judge whether or not he is the right man for the Job, however at the end of the day he still sits in the same office he has for most of his time with Batman.<\/p><h3><strong>The Road Home<\/strong><\/h3><p><b>For further details:<\/b> <em><a href=\"\/batman-return-of-bruce-wayne\/4045-56130\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56130\">Batman: the Return of Bruce Wayne<\/a><\/em> and <em><a href=\"\/bruce-wayne-the-road-home\/4045-56239\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56239\">Bruce Wayne: the Road Home<\/a><\/em><\/p><p>Bruce wanted to see who was best for helping him continue his new war on crime.

When Gordon arrives, Bullock informs Jim that the aviary cages are all automated from the control room and there is some troubling video footage from the security cameras that Jim needs to see. Gordon sees the image of a man who resembles his son <a href=\"\/james-gordon-jr\/4005-70633\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70633\">James Jr.<\/a> . This troubling assumption begins to trouble Gordon and soon he becomes haunted by the visions of past unsolved case files that involved murdered children.<\/p><p>Fifteen years ago, Gordon was moving up the ranks within the precinct when he started investigating a string of eight murders that involved the Peter Pan Killer who would sneak into family homes and abduct children from their beds then murder them. Gordon apprehended the Peter Pan Killer when he attempted to abduct a young James Jr.<\/p><p>Now after 15 years, Gordon heads to Blackgate to interrogate the Peter Pan Killer before he was released from prison. Gordon wanted to find out why the killer didn\u2019t go through with kidnapping James Jr. The killer reveals that he was going to kill Gordon Jr. rather than abducting him because James Jr. gave the killer an ominous stare when he entered the boy\u2019s room. The killer also reveals that he murdered a young girl who was friends with Oracle before he visited Gordon\u2019s apartment.<\/p><p>This revelation causes Gordon wonder about his son\u2019s innocence and what exactly happened to the young girl. Oracle has always been under the assumption that James Jr. murdered her friend Bess because she saw James Jr. playing with her friend\u2019s apartment keys with smug look on his face. Gordon has heard this story from Babs before but now he doubts if Babs\u2019 story is actually true. There is a possibility that the killer took the young girl\u2019s keys and dropped them at the Gordon\u2019s apartment by accident. After his conversation with the Peter Pan Killer, Gordon threatens the killer that he will be followed at all times in order to prevent another murder.<\/p><p>Later on that same day, Gordon invites Oracle for some coffee at Bay Diner and talks to her about his findings. Jim tells Barbara that her brother, <a href=\"\/james-gordon-jr\/4005-70633\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70633\">James Jr.<\/a>, is back in Gotham City. Barbara asks her father if he really thinks it's him coming back, and Jim replies yes. As they continue their talk, Barbara reminds her father that Jim Jr. is really smart and cunning. Jim tells her that it's going to be all right and that they've got police officers looking out for him. Oracle still sticks by her story and she leaves her father with lingering doubts but then James Jr. appears from other side of the diner, staring at his father. James Jr. sits down with his father and explains his return to Gotham. James Jr. begins by apologizing to his father for the theatrics at the aviary. James tells the commissioner that his mother (Barbara Sr.) sent him to Arkham for a psychological evaluation and the doctors clinically diagnosed him as mentally unstable in regards to exhibiting apathetic behavior. However, the doctors prescribed an experimental medicine to help James in stabilizing his emotional imbalance.<\/p><p>James also overheard Oracle's convictions about him and he swears to his father that he has never killed anybody. Gordon still doesn't know what to think about his son until James informs him about his volunteer work at Dr. Thompkins' clinic. James Jr. leaves the cafe and asks that his father will hopefully find it in his heart to forgive him. For a while, Gordon feels this extreme sense of relief that his son is misunderstood but he is changing for the better. When Gordon reaches his apartment, he finds a trail of blood. Gordon follows the trail to James Jr.'s old room. The trail ends in James' closet. Gordon opens the door and finds the body of a schoolyard bully that James Jr. fell victim to when he was young.<\/p><p>It seems everyone was right about James Jr. even though Gordon tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Gordon immediately goes to the clinic and finds Dr. Thompkins. Gordon confronts Leslie by demanding to know where his son is. Leslie informs Gordon that his son is a model volunteer because anything she asks him to do, he \"happily\" does. Over time, Leslie has given James Jr. more responsibilities like making \"nutrition runs\" for newborn babies who come from poor families. Gordon doesn't want to panic Leslie by telling her what he had found at his apartment so he humbly asks her to call him the moment James comes in for his shift. Leslie agrees to Gordon's request and she tries to calm his worries by showing him James' office.<\/p><p>Leslie flips on the lights in James' office and gives Gordon a tour. As Leslie professes how great James is, Gordon on the other hand, can't believe that Leslie would be so naive to willingly put her full trust in someone like James. Gordon peers around the office and finds a vile of James' medicine. The medicine is called Diaxemene which is designed to release a chemical in the brain so the patient can feel empathy. Gordon takes a pill from the vile, thanks Leslie for the tour and makes his way to Barbara's place at Kord Tower.<\/p><p>Gordon gives Barbara the pill that he took from James' office and asks her to run a couple of tests. Barbara knew something was going on with James but she didn't want to rub in her father's face because she could see that Gordon still wanted to hold onto any hope of saving his son. Barbara figures the medicine is supposed to help James in treating or possibly curing his psychotic tendencies but Diaxemene is still in the testing phases and hasn't been approved by the FDA. Gordon is hoping he can convince James to undergo some blood work in order to make sure that he has been taking his pills.<\/p><p>Gordon leaves Barbara to her work while he heads back to the clinic. Barbara breaks down the pill's components and she makes a startling discovery. James has reversed the effect of the pill and now the pill is designed to chemically induce apathy rather than empathy in a certain section of the brain. However, the dosage of James' pill is of such low grade that it wouldn't affect an adult. Barbara relays all of her findings to Gordon's cell phone. Gordon can't understand why James would concoct a pill with such a low dosage then it hits him. Leslie made James responsible for the \"nutrition runs\" at her clinic. James has been putting his pills in the baby formula and giving it to all the newborns thereby ensuring their development into becoming psychopaths.<\/p><p>Just as Gordon reached the clinic, he is stopped by Det. Bullock who has some really bad news. Bullock says the Joker has escaped Arkham and something horrible has happened to Gordon's ex-wife. Gordon acts quickly by warning Leslie about James then he calls in a small task force to station themselves at the clinic and wait for James to return. Gordon must put the hunt for his deranged son in the hands of his brothers in blue while he accompanies Bullock. Bullock tells Gordon that he received an anonymous phone call from someone who said Barbara Gordon is going to die at the Gotham Plaza Hotel. Gordon and Bullock reach the hotel room where Barbara was staying at and as Gordon entered, he notices a light coming from the bathroom. Gordon falls to his knees in tears because he has found his beloved ex-wife nude in the bath tub with a crimson smile across her face.<\/p><p>Gordon rushes Barbara to the lab at Wayne Enterprises while Bullock calls in Oracle and tells her what has just happened. Oracle reacts by calling Dick and having him meet her father at the lab. Oracle runs a few tests on her mother while Dick injects the anti-Joker Venom. Fortunately, Gordon got to Barbara just in time to save her and the Joker Venom was a derivative of the original. Gordon at this point wants Joker's head on a pike for all the misery he has brought to the Gordons but Dick convinces Gordon that there is no way the Joker could have escaped Arkham and found out where Barbara was so quickly. Dick promises Gordon that he will find Joker and make him talk.<\/p><p>Dick heads to Arkham and conducts a complete sweep of the crime scene. From what Dick could deduce, Joker didn't get very far from Arkham because Dick begins follow a trail of Joker's sweat which seems to be secreting Joker Venom. Dick follows the trail to an abandoned section of Arkham. At this point, Dick figures that Joker must have discovered Victor Zsasz's underground path which leads to the catacombs beneath Arkham. Zsasz used this path to escape Arkham so he could freely kill anyone he wanted in Gotham then he would make his way back to Arkham as if he had never escaped at all.<\/p><p>Dick finds Joker in a dank corner of the catacombs. He notices Joker mumbling to himself about being disappointed. Dick apprehends Joker and begins to interrogate him. Joker starts off by complaining about the fact that Dick isn't the real Batman by saying \"You don't scare me little bird\u201d and he isn't saying a word until the real Batman returns. Dick decides to beat down on the Joker until he reveals who he hired to attack Barbara Gordon. Joker laughs hysterically because according to him, the real Batman would have figured out that the Joker does his own dirty work and he would never send some errand boy to take credit for his fun. Dick finally realizes that the Joker was able to escape simply because someone needed him to be the scapegoat for the attack on Barbara Gordon and they were counting on Commissioner Gordon to retaliate by ending the Joker once and for all.<\/p><p>Back at the lab, Gordon sat by Barbara's side as Bullock escorted Oracle back to her apartment. Barbara eventually wakes up and when she laid her eyes on Gordon, she immediately began to scream for help. A doctor comes rushing and injects a sedative into Barbara. Gordon finally realizes that James injected the Joker Venom into his mother as a way to get back at her for institutionalizing him while at the same time he wanted Gordon to think the Joker was responsible for the attack on Barbara in order to bait him into killing the Joker. If Gordon knows how calculating his son can be then he would guess that James has already realized his plan to manipulate everything is falling apart which leaves only one person left for him to torture...Oracle.<\/p><p>Bullock drops Oracle off at her apartment doorstep and just as she entered her apartment, James closes the door right behind her. James and Oracle enter a discussion about on how depraved he is. James respects Oracle because she is the only one who can see him for what he is. Barbara replies to his compliment with a scoff. Oracle always knew James was disturbed and most of those people that he has already killed were actually victims rather people who had it coming. In short, Oracle realizes that James tries to find flaws or start something with another person just so he can justify as well as satisfy his violent tendencies. James smiles and his respect for Oracle's deduction has reached new lengths.<\/p><h3><strong>New 52 <\/strong><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106890\/2017476-jg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017476\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5257731958763\" data-width=\"582\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 582px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106890\/2017476-jg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2017476\"><img alt=\"James Gordon In The New 52\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106890\/2017476-jg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106890\/2017476-jg.jpg 582w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106890\/2017476-jg.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"James Gordon In The New 52\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106890\/2017476-jg.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/106890\/2017476-jg.jpg 582w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/106890\/2017476-jg.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>James Gordon In The New 52<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>It was announced that DC Comics would relaunch their entire line and starting in September 2011 52 new #1's would begin to be released.<\/p><p>Jim Gordon appears in both <em>Detective Comics<\/em> and <em>Batgirl<\/em> with red hair and mustache and appearing several years younger.<\/p><h3>Zero Year<\/h3><p>During the events of Zero Year, Gordon helped Batman and Lucius Fox defeat the Riddler and regain control Gotham City.

In Batman Eternal, Gordon shoots a criminal he is chasing who he believes to holding a gun in a subway. The shot injures the man and hits an electrical box in the subway, causing the train to crash and dozens of people to die. Gordon is imprisoned, and while in prison he meets his son, finding out that he is not actually dead. His son offers him a way out of jail, but he refuses. Batman continues to try to figure out if Jim was drugged or not when he shot the man, as new police officers take over the force, causing more issues, until Officer Bard, who Gordon recruited, fixes things back up and begins to earn the trust of Batman.<\/p><p>Along other followers of Batman, he comes to the place where this combat against Lincon March after being attacked by Spoiler, although this escapes see too many enemies and the battle exhaustion.<\/p><h3>Batman Endgame<\/h3><p>Unemployed ..

Despite a group of young and capable young police recruits volunteering for the program, Geri believes that none other than Jim Gordon himself are capable of becoming the new Batman that Gotham City needs. Initially turning her down, Jim eventually agrees to become the new Batman after seeing that one of the new recruits has a young child and a wife back at home. After a conversation with Harvey Bullock, Jim goes to his new apartment in Powers Internationals main facility to find a 10-foot tall trench coat, courtesy of Harvey Bullock.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>During his first initial outing as Batman, Gordon goes up against a being made of energy wreaking havoc in Little Cuba, located in the Narrows. Batman deploys, with the aid of Julia Pennyworth, under the guise of Julia Perry, and Daryl Gutierrez, a young genius who designed the new robotic Batsuit. Batman attempts to use an EMP pulse on the energy being, but it has no effect. Eventually Batman realizes the being is simply a projection and the main power source is somewhere close. With the help of Julia and Daryl, Batman is able to figure out that the being is a distraction from a bank robbery, and the projection is being powered by Precious Precious of the Whisper Gang, who is holding famous baseball layer Dodger Valera hostage in order to gain access to his safe at the bank. Meanwhile, in Dodger Valeras apartment, Precious Precious remarks on how the Batman he sees outside isn't the real Batman, and doesn't even look like Batman. Suddenly he's struck with an electrified batarang, courtesy of James Gordon, the new Batman, decked out in a new skin-tight black suit with yellow adornments. Holding a batarang gun, Batman asks if he looks more like Batman now.<\/p><p>Later at the Gotham City morgue, Precious Precious is revealed to have quickly died due to lethal radiation poisoning, caused by a seed sewn into his body which also granted him his ability to project his energy as the energy being that Batman had previously fought. The seed reveals a link between Precious Precious and various other recently deceased members of various gangs in the Narrows who were also caused by the radioactive seeds at varying lengths, alluding to these people being guinea pigs for a larger experiment involving the seeds. Jim reveals that all of the deceased gang members are also linked together in that he was the one who arrested all of them, causing Commissioner Sawyer to remark that Jim has his very first super villain. Jim asks Sawyer to keep him updated if anything comes up regarding the seeds, but Sawyer refuses, saying he needs to follow the checks and balances system set out for him to maintain his accountability, otherwise he'll be shut down. Back at the Powers International facility, Jim practices throwing batarangs by hand. Julia Pennyworth (under the guise of Julia Perry) approaches him and asks if he's disturbed about Gordon denies that he's feeling disturbed. Julia then asks Daryl to turn on the lights, and in doing so reveals Batmans new Batmobile, or Bat-Truck, as Julia describes it; a semi-truck mobile cave cashing in at over fifteen-million dollars. Suddenly, the team gets an alert of a emergency in Chinatown, another part of the Narrows. Upon reaching the scene, Batman is hit with a mass of bricks and slammed into the floor. Remarking that a building had just punched him, he gets up to see an enemy from his past: Gee Gee Heung of the Devil Pigs gang. Jim and Gee Gee go back, as Jim removed one of Gee Gees status-indicating subdermal horns when they last encountered each other. Gee Gee begins to surround himself in brick and silicate, and Daryl reveals that Gee Gee seems to be able to convert his body's power into magnetism, allowing him to draw the material to himself to use for whatever he likes. In this instance, he forms a massive, brick Batman. Batman responds by using the thermal weapons in his suit, which turns the brick-Batman into an oven surrounding Gee Gee. However, just as he's about to deliver the final blow, Batman is thrown into the river by a stream of bricks which then slams and traps him at the bottom of the Gotham River. Unable to eject, Batman calls in the new Bat-Truck to fall directly on Gee Gee Heung and his brick-Batman suit, which quickly ends the fight. Batman approaches Gee Gee and tels him that he needs immediate medical attention due to the presence of the seed in his body. Gee Gee ignores him, saying that Mr. Bloom, the creator of the seeds, will find Batman and that he's raising an army with his seeds. Batman asks who Mr. Bloom is, but before he can get any information, Gee Gee succumbs to the radiation poisoning thanks to the seed in his body. Later on, back at the Powers facility, Jim is again practicing with throwing batarangs by hand. After a quick conversation with Julia, Jim asks if she worked with the previous Batman, something she had previously denied (which was actually one of the reasons she had been hired by Powers in the first place). Julia reveals that she worked with the previous Batman for a little while before his death, and that his code for Batman wasn't something that he tried to be, but rather it was just who he was. She advises Jim to do the same, to let his own code become who his Batman is, because that's what the city needs at the moment. The two leave, with Julia going on to advise Jim to keep the batarang gun as it suits him. Later on, Jim Gordon goes to the Lucious Fox recreational center for kids to ask an amnesiac Bruce Wayne for help, after revealing that he's the new Batman.<\/p><h2><strong>Powers and Abilities<\/strong><\/h2><p>James Gordon is an expert detective, showing so as a long-time ally of Batman, usually assisting Bruce Wayne in his numerous adventures and mysteries. He is also the head of his police force, is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant (shown to be able to best Russian Spestnaz in combat) and weapons expert. He usually carries around a pistol for self defense and often times shown to have other officers nearby him.<\/p><p>After the apparent death of Bruce Waynes Batman, Jim Gordon underwent rigorous training in order to become the new Batman sponsored by Powers International. In three months time, Jim was able to put on a significant amount of muscle and quit smoking cigarettes. With his new physique, Jim Gordon is able to hold his own against a couple gang members on his own, but the experience gap between himself and the previous Batman still leaves him open to surprise attacks.<\/p><h2><strong>Equipment<\/strong><\/h2><p><strong>Batsuit:<\/strong> Jim Gordons Batsuit is a sleek, skintight black suit with a large bat-insignia spread across the chest. The insignia is outlined in yellow, with black in the middle except for the \"head\" which is colored in with yellow to give it the appearance of having fangs. The suit comes with a utility belt that doubles as a holster for his batarang gun, albeit his belt is much less elaborate than his predecessors'.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Digital Camouflage<\/strong>: the suit is able to render itself completely invisible<\/li><li><strong>Molecular Contractor<\/strong>: Located on his fingertips, a small charge is emitted which contracts the molecules of a nearby object or surface, essentially shrinking it. Examples include shrinking a window so as to avoid shattering or cutting glass, making for a stealthier entry, or shrinking the missile barrels on the robotic Batsuit to cause its attacks to explode within itself when it had been turned against Jim by Mr. Bloom.<\/li><li><strong>Temperature Resistance<\/strong>. Jims Batsuit can withstand temperatures up to 14,000 degrees fahrenheit before it will give out.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Batarang Gun<\/strong>: Befitting his history as a marine and a law enforcement officer, Jim Gordon uses a batarang gun rather than throwing the batarangs like shuriken like his predecessor. The batarang ammo are equipped with their own power source, turning them into taser-batarangs when fired or even thrown by hand. Jim is very proficient with this weapon, capable to holding his own against multiple gang members equipped with automatic weapons.<\/p><p><strong>Exo-Batsuit:<\/strong> Jims robotic exo-suit is a nanofiber state-of-the-art mechanical suit of armor. The suit is also equipped with new elements and compounds developed by Powers International.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Durability:<\/strong> The Exo-Batsuit is able to withstand free-falling and landing upright after dropping from a blimp high above Gotham City. The suit is also able to withstand being hit with a wave of bricks, thrown through the city, and slammed into the street below. The suit has also held up after having an entire semi-truck thrown on top of it.<\/li><li><strong>Temperature Weapons:<\/strong> The suit is equipped with thermal energy weapons.<\/li><li><strong>Retractable Bat-Shield:<\/strong> The suit is equipped with a retractable shield in at least one of its forearms. The shield is capable of withstanding the impact and explosion of a car after it was thrown at him during a fight with an energy villain.<\/li><li><strong>Voice Command:<\/strong> The suit is capable of understanding voice commands if it has been familiarized with the commanders voice. Jim Gordon activates these commands by calling the suit \"Rookie\"<\/li><li><strong>Enhanced Strength:<\/strong> Fitting its size, the suit is capable of lifting large amounts of weight, probably near the 5-10 ton range. The suit was able to use full grown sharks as melee weapons. The suit is strong enough to effortlessly suspend a fully grown man off the ground with one arm and then throw him through a roof and into the path of a nearby helicopter.<\/li><li><strong>Artillery:<\/strong> The suit is equipped with ten shoulder-mounted missiles-- five on each shoulder.<\/li><li><strong>EMP:<\/strong> The suit is able to emit a powerful EMP pulse.<\/li><\/ul><h2><strong>Character Profile<\/strong><\/h2><ul><li><strong>Real Name:<\/strong> James \"Jim\" W.

When he was a child, he visited the circus with his parents and managed to get a photo with the Graysons before the show. That night, Tim met <a href=\"\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson<\/a> before the young acrobat's parents were assassinated.<\/p><p>Tim Drake had followed Batman and Robin's career ever since the murder of the <a href=\"\/flying-graysons\/4060-55863\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55863\">Flying Graysons<\/a>. One day, he saw the original Robin on television performing a move he had seen Dick Grayson perform at the circus; he quickly made the connection that Dick Grayson was Robin, and after learning that Dick Grayson was the ward of <a href=\"\/batman\/4005-1699\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Bruce Wayne<\/a>, he realized that Bruce Wayne was Batman.<\/p><p>After the death of <a href=\"\/jason-todd\/4005-6849\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Jason Todd<\/a>, Batman grew more violent and reckless. Tim noticed that this wasn't in Batman\u2019s true character, and he sought Dick's help. At this time, Dick was going by the code-name Nightwing. Tim tried to convince Dick to retake the mantle of Robin, saying it was the only way to keep Batman sane. Dick partially agreed to this, but said that he would only help Batman as Nightwing. Tim did not like Dick\u2019s decision, maintaining that Batman needed a Robin. Eventually, he was able to get <a href=\"\/alfred\/4005-5556\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5556\">Alfred<\/a> to assist in altering the Robin costume so that he could help Batman himself. Alfred and Dick gave Tim their approval as the new Robin, but only so he could keep Batman sane. However, Batman protested that he did not want a new partner, while noting Tim's potential. Eventually, Batman accepted Tim as Robin under one condition: Tim had to endure physical and mental training before he could become Robin so that he would not suffer the same fate as Jason Todd.<\/p><p>While Tim was training, his parents were kidnapped. Tim continued to focus on his work and foiled the plans of a hacker thief. Meanwhile, Batman went to rescue Tim\u2019s parents. However, Batman arrived too late. They had been poisoned -- his mother killed, and his father in a coma. Batman worried the tragedy might cloud Tim's mind with thoughts of revenge, but he was reassured when Tim saved Batman and Vicki Vale from the <a href=\"\/scarecrow\/4005-3726\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3726\">Scarecrow<\/a>. Afterwards, Batman allowed Tim to take on the mantle of the Boy Wonder, and gave him a modernized version of the costume.<\/p><h3>New 52 Origin<\/h3><p>In the New 52, Tim uncovered the identity of Batman, but pretended to have failed. Feigning defeat, and eager to get Batman's attention once more, he stole $100 million from the Penguin, giving the money to those less fortunate. When the Penguin realized this, he sent assassins to kill Tim and his family, but he is saved by Batman. Tim's parents are put into witness protection, and Tim is put in the care of Batman. Adopting the name Red Robin, Tim becomes Batman's partner.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Tim Drake was created by <a href=\"..\/..\/marv-wolfman\/26-41478\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marv Wolfman<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/pat-broderick\/26-14037\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pat Broderick<\/a>.

The choice to don the Red Robin was deliberate as he knew he'd have to cross lines that Robin couldn't. The reputation of Red Robin was already tarnished by the now-forsaken Jason Todd, and thus Tim knew that, should he be caught, he wouldn't be traced back to Dick, Damian or Alfred who were all still fighting Bruce's fight in Gotham.<\/p><p>As Red Robin, Tim became a reluctant ally of <a href=\"..\/..\/ras-al-ghul\/29-40816\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ra's al Ghul<\/a>, who was also interested in discovering what truly happened to Batman.

Tim noticed an organized crime group lead by <a href=\"\/\">King Snake<\/a>, so he decided to try and stop them. However, <a href=\"\/\">Lady Shiva<\/a> had been pursuing King Snake also, and she discovers the potential that Tim had in martial arts. Lady Shiva takes Tim in and decides to train him herself.

Nearing the end of his training, Lady Shiva and Tim had a sparring match in which Tim defeats her with the bo staff. Shiva then presents Tim with a gift. It is a retractable bo staff that he could conceal. King Snake planned to release a plague, but he was stopped by Tim and Lady Shiva. While King Snake was hanging onto the building helplessly, Shiva orders Tim to kill him in order to \"graduate\".

When Tim had to rescue the Young Justice from <a href=\"..\/..\/apokolips\/34-41470\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apokolips<\/a>, he discovers that more than half the team has lost trust in Tim due to the actions of Batman.

Tim was replaced by his girlfriend Stephanie Brown as Robin for a short time, until she disobeyed Batman's orders. When Black Mask escalated the War Games even further, Tim decided to become Robin once more. Jack finds out that Tim disobeyed him, but despite the dangers, he reluctantly allowed Tim to continue as Robin.<\/p><p>Later, during the events of <a href=\"\/identity-crisis\/4045-48398\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-48398\">Identity Crisis<\/a>, his father is murdered at the hands of Captain Boomerang, and he is formally adopted by Bruce Wayne.<\/p><h3>Red Robin<\/h3><p>Tim's time as Robin came to a close under tumultuous circumstances with his father's recent murder; as well as the deaths of both his best friend, Superboy, and his adoptive father, Bruce Wayne in the events of <a href=\"\/infinite-crisis\/4045-40765\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis<\/a> and <a href=\"\/final-crisis\/4045-51642\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-51642\">Final Crisis<\/a>.<\/p><p>With Bruce gone, Dick Grayson took on the mantle of Batman, with <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/damian-wayne\/4005-42413\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42413\">Damian Wayne<\/a> as his Robin.

Tim was the first person to suggest to Batman that it was Bane who was responsible for these actions. Tim and Batman set out to catch the criminals. They got off to a good start by taking down the Mad Hatter\u2019s tea party and bringing half a dozen thugs with him. Batman decided that the two would separate to take down more criminals in a shorter time. Robin went after Bird, one of Bane\u2019s lackeys and Batman went after Zsasz. Robin was briefly captured by Bane and Killer Croc but escaped soon after. Robin would eventually try and succeed to track down Firefly, but Robin is mentally and physically drained so Batman told him to sit this one out in the Batcave. Tim\u2019s rest would be short lived when the Riddler held a live hostage T.V show [although he had a fake bomb] Robin beat the Riddler and saved the hostages.<\/p><p>Robin was with Alfred when Bane broke Batman\u2019s back and threw him from a roof top in downtown. They acquired an ambulance and took Bruce back to the Batcave. Robin wanted to take Bruce to hospital but it was too big of a risk to expose all the identities of the <a href=\"..\/..\/batman-family\/65-45515\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bat Family<\/a> . All Robin could do is stay by Bruce\u2019s bedside and pray. Thankfully Bruce did not die but when he woke up, he was psychologically scarred, as his defeat to Bane came as a big blow to Bruce mentally [in addition to his broken back]. Tim could barely stand to watch his mentor so shattered but he stayed the course, helping Alfred recruit Dr. Shondra Kingsolving to be Bruce\u2019s personal physician. Once Bruce was in better spirits, Tim talks about the escalating violence and gang war in Gotham. Tim told Bruce about how someone should step in as Batman while Bruce heals. Bruce agrees but turns down Tim\u2019s suggestions that Nightwing should take the mantle of Batman, saying he is his own man now with his own responsibilities (the real reason that Bruce did not want Dick to take the mantle is because he was scared that Dick would run into Bane and get injured like he did), so Bruce picked Azrael (Jean-Paul Valley). Tim gave Azrael the Batman costume, which Azrael modified.<\/p><p>Bruce\u2019s condition was partially heartbreaking for Robin, given that his father, Jack, was still learning how to use his body parts again after coming out of his coma. Robin went out on patrol with the new Batman and was dismayed with the amount of violence Azrael used to capture the criminals and Tim had to keep reminding Azrael that there was more to being Batman than just a costume, but Azrael became more and more lost in his role and actually killed a criminal. Bruce realized that if Bane worked out his identity that meant he knew Tim\u2019s as well. Bruce\u2019s hunch was right and he and Alfred set of to the Drake home to rescue Jack who had been kidnapped.<\/p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-441212\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17962\/441212-sans_titre_21_copie.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.395881006865\" data-width=\"437\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 437px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17962\/441212-sans_titre_21_copie.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-441212\"><img alt=\"Incredulous at the new Batman designs\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" data-width=\"458\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17962\/441212-sans_titre_21_copie.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17962\/441212-sans_titre_21_copie.jpg 437w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Incredulous at the new Batman designs\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17962\/441212-sans_titre_21_copie.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17962\/441212-sans_titre_21_copie.jpg 437w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" data-width=\"458\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Incredulous at the new Batman designs<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Tim wanted to go and save his father but Bruce told Tim that Azrael needed him and that Bruce would go and save him. Azrael kept getting more and more violent and started to reject Tim. Tim also found himself spending more time with Nightwing, and the two eventually established an almost perfect partnership stopping many villains together. Tim told Dick that he felt responsible for Azrael\u2019s recklessness. Dick told Tim that it wasn\u2019t his fault and that he was surprised that Bruce did not ask him to take the mantle.<\/p><p>Tim came across Azrael fighting Bane on a railway. Robin manages to save the people on the train as the new Batman beats Bane. And much to the relief of Robin, Azrael does not kill Bane. Although Azrael did not kill Bane he was still acting reckless. The \u201csystem\u201d played havoc with Azrael and he finally snapped under the strain of the system and one night in the bat cave he attacked Robin, who barely escaped. After this, Azrael locked himself in the bat cave. Around this time Bruce and Alfred returned with Jack; Bruce\u2019s back was mystically healed by an unknown man. Bruce was happy with Tim\u2019s progress, but was a bit mad at Tim for not stopping Azrael killing someone. All Tim said is that Azrael is out of control and has locked himself in the bat cave. Bruce decided to take the mantle back by force; this meant a trip to Lady Shiva for a crash course to get him back to his peak. Tim was very happy that Bruce and his father were back safely.<\/p><p>Bruce \u201cgraduated\u201d from Shiva\u2019s training with the support of Robin and Nightwing but Bruce wanted to face Azrael alone. Bruce beat Azrael, but instead of starting as Batman straight away, Bruce decided that he needed some time off to train more. Bruce gave the mantle to the man who should got it the first time: Dick Grayson. The new Batman and Robin got along very well and again formed a near perfect partnership. After some time, Bruce returned and Dick gave back the mantle of Batman and regained his identity as Nightwing. Tim and Dick have formed a brotherly bond and often team up.<\/p><h3>Legacy<\/h3><p>Tim alongside Batman and Nightwing travel to a desert and try to prevent Ra's Al Ghul finding the ancient wheel of plagues, but are stopped by Ra's minions and his newest follower Bane. Following their loss in the desert, Tim and Nightwing head to Paris to stop the release of Ra's plague, which would have wiped out most life in Paris. Unable to find them in the unfamiliar city, Tim seeks the aid of manhunter <a href=\"\/henri-ducard\/4005-62927\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62927\">Henri Ducard<\/a>. Together him and Tim track down several of Ra's followers in the Louvre, while the injured Nightwing defeats the remaining, while Tim questions Henri's lethal methods. He then returns to Gotham alongside Nightwing to assist Batman and Huntress in stopping the final plague from being released. Following preventing it Batman begins his rematch with Bane, as Robin, Nightwing, and <a href=\"\/huntress\/4005-1690\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1690\">Huntress<\/a>. While Nightwing and Huntress distract Ra's and his men, Tim sneaks into the computer room linking Oracle to the system, purging all traces of the plague before the ship blows up.<\/p><h3>No Man's Land<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1340219\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59958\/1340219-daw.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.97297297297297\" data-width=\"185\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 185px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59958\/1340219-daw.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1340219\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px\" data-width=\"185\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59958\/1340219-daw.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59958\/1340219-daw.jpg 185w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59958\/1340219-daw.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59958\/1340219-daw.jpg 185w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px\" data-width=\"185\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Following Gotham's destruction during the earthquake, Tim begins to realize his growing feelings for <a href=\"\/stephanie-brown\/4005-6156\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6156\">Stephanie Brown<\/a>.

His father's urging ultimately became one of the catalyst for Gotham to no longer be a No Man's Land.<\/p><h3>Officer Down<\/h3><p>After <a href=\"\/james-gordon\/4005-3727\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3727\">James Gordon<\/a> is shot, Tim is one of the heroes called in by Oracle to search for <a href=\"\/catwoman\/4005-1698\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1698\">Catwoman<\/a>, the suspect in the shooting. He works alongside Azrael, Batgirl and Nightwing with all of them splitting up to talk to people who Catwoman knows, who let them know her plan to steal a set of rare emeralds about to go off display.The four heroes then go after her, battling her men as Tim chases her down tripping her only to learn it is Harley Quinn, who lets them know Catwoman's location so they can help her clear her name.<\/p><p>Upon finding Catwoman, she runs being chased by Robin, before being chased by Nightwing, Azrael and Batgirl in order to allow her to tire herself out. They then corner her, which she jumps from a roof landing on a net they had set up, before Tim electrocutes her. When she awakens, she reveals the shooter was a G.C.P.D. officer and she has stashed the weapon he used on Gordon,before Robin makes a joke prompting Catwoman to attack him to be restrained by Batgirl. Nightwing then lets her go, to take the gun for testing from Oracle who discovers the shooter's identity. However the G.C.P.D. is ultimately unable to gather a confession leading to the shooter walking, and Gordon's retirement.<\/p><h3>Batman: Family<\/h3><p>Sylvia tells Tim how she &amp; Roger met. Roger was covering the trial of a mobster for the Boston Herald and Sylvia was dating the mobster. Tim asks Sylvia why Roger was trying to get Bruce's attention at the charity gala. Sylvia then pulls out a CD from a picture frame and gives it to Tim. All of a sudden, Freeway comes crashing through the window of Sylvia's apartment and disarms Tim with a few quick blows to his body. Freeway then grabs Sylvia and snaps her neck.<\/p><p>Tim tries to get back on his feet after failing to save Sylvia's life. Freeway then knocks out Tim with a gas pellet of chloral hydrate designed by Doctor Excess. When Tim awakens in a warehouse, he vaguely remembers that Freeway was the same man who stole the Batmobile for a short time. Freeway stripped Tim of all of his weapons and tools. Freeway decides to have Doctor Excess torture Tim for information on the Batman. Freeway got a hold of Bruce's fingerprints from the Batmobile but the fingerprints were fake. The prints instead belonged to James Scott Westerberg, a car thief who died in Blackgate five years ago.<\/p><p>Tim scoffs at Doctor Excess by saying he must not be registered with the AMA. The doctor is amused by Tim's mockery and says the practices of the AMA are outdated. Doctor Excess considers himself a practioner of human potential. He believes in better living through chemistry and surgery. The doctor then recalls how Celia found him in Honduras during Reagan's war campaign against drugs. The doctor was concocting poisons for the special forces to use against the Sandinistas.<\/p><p>The doctor prepares his nanotech cocktail syringe. Once injected, the nanomites will latch onto Tim's nervous system and they will be wired to a remote control. The doctor likes to inflict Pavlovian torture in which a person feels pain &amp; pleasure at the same time. Fortunately, Tim has a trick fingernail with a key that can unlocks cuffs. Just as the doctor was about to the nanotech syringe, Tim surprises the doctor with a blow to the head. The doctor cringes from the pain while Freeway &amp; Tim have a rematch.<\/p><p>Freeway is aware of Tim's training days with Lady Shiva and asks if he has had the pleasure of seeing Shiva's tattoo which is located near her pelvis. The doctor recovers and charges after Tim with his nanotech syringe. Tim senses the doctor getting closer so he dodges Freeway's attacks with a back flip. He then kicks the doctor into Freeway's path. The doctor accidently injects the nanomites into Freeway and Tim grabs a hold of the nanotech remote control.<\/p><p>Tim triggers the remote and immobilizes Freeway. Tim grabs the CD from Freeway's jacket but the doctor shuts down the fuse box to the warehouse causing everything to go pitch black. Excess and Freeway make their getaway but at least Tim has Sloane's disc. Freeway reports his failure to Celia. Celia begins to question Freeway's combat techniques since Suicide King was his prized student but she isn't entirely disappointed since her plan to siphon off what's left of Wayne Enterprises.<\/p><p>The disc contains info about the Network's dealings in Texas, Rio, Milan, Santa Prisca, Taiwan and Stuttgart.<\/p><h3>War Games<\/h3><p>Shortly before Gotham's biggest gang war ever, <a href=\"\/jack-drake\/4005-6852\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6852\">Jack Drake<\/a> discovered his son's dual identity and confronts Bruce Wayne threatening to expose everything, Tim however agrees to give up the mantle in order to protect the others identities. After Tim's retirement Batman offers Tim's girlfriend <a href=\"\/stephanie-brown\/4005-6156\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6156\">Stephanie Brown<\/a> the mantle of Robin, however he fires her when she can't measure up to Tim. She then seeks to earn Batman's approval by stealing a contingency plan from the <a href=\"\/batcave\/4020-31340\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-31340\">Batcave<\/a>, but fails to implement it as Batman had not informed her that he was secretly Matches Malone, causing the heads of every major Gotham crime family to open fire killing each other, plunging Gotham into a gang war.<\/p><p>When the gang war begins to get more deadly, Tim is forced to sit back and watch on the news having to abide by the promise he made to his father to stay out.

Tim, with no costume or equipment is forced to improvise and battle all the gang members, while rushing students into the school and barricading the doors,before Darla is shot by a gunmen who made it into the school.<\/p><p>Tim then leads the others to the nurse's office, where they hold up waiting to be rescued. They eventually are when Nightwing, Batgirl and Batman infiltrate the school defeating the gun men, but not before being captured on video by Gotham's media.Shortly after incidence at his school, Tim resumes the mantle of Robin feeling it wrong not to do anything to help, having a talk on the a rooftop where his dad accepts the city needs him. Tim, along with Jack and his wife <a href=\"\/dana-drake\/4005-9285\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9285\">Dana Drake<\/a> then begin assisting <a href=\"\/leslie-thompkins\/4005-3740\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3740\">Leslie Thompkins<\/a> , donating blood as well as helping in the free clinic.<\/p><p>Following Black Mask fooling everyone disguised as Orpheus, all the Gotham's gangs are united under his control.

After Black Mask takes over Oracle's clock tower, and begins his battle to the death with Batman. Robin alongside Batgirl, Onyx, Tarantula, and Catwoman battle Scarecrow who had mutated into his Scarebeast form following Black Mask's betrayal. Tim then comes up with a plan so that they can defeat the Scarebeast without the police firing upon them, telling the commanding officer that they will surrender without resistance following it's defeat Tim reveals he lied before assisting in search efforts.<\/p><p>After the end of the Gang War, Tim informs Bruce that he's leaving as Gotham has become to dangerous, with Batgirl leaving with him.

Tim arrives and they figure that someone is threatening him. Jack assures Tim that whatever happens is not his fault. Eventually the mystery man turns out to be <a href=\"\/captain-boomerang\/4005-29992\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29992\">Captain Boomerang<\/a> (Digger Harkness). Jack and Captain Boomerang exchange shots and in the end killed each other. Batman and Robin arrived too late to save Jack. Bruce offers to adopt Tim, however Tim did not like the idea. Instead, Tim decided to create fake records about an Uncle living in <a href=\"..\/..\/wikid\/bludhaven\/34-55771\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bl\u00fcdhaven<\/a>. His fake uncle would be his legal guardian and Tim would eventually move to Bl\u00fcdhaven. The reason his stepmother Dana did not take custody was because she checked in to a mental hospital to help her deal with the death of her husband, Tim's father. Batman would eventually be able to uncover the lies Tim tried to hide and discovers what he was truly doing. Batman became impressed with Tim rather than angry, and offered to teach him how to fully cover his tracks.<\/p><h3>The Return of Jason Todd<\/h3><p>Later, a mystery villain began to appear claiming his alias as Red Hood, an alias that had once been taken by the <a href=\"..\/..\/joker\/29-1702\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joker<\/a>. It would later be discovered that Red Hood was actually <a href=\"..\/..\/jason-todd\/29-6849\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jason Todd<\/a>. Jason continued to make Batman suffer, but was also intrigued with who had replaced him and why everyone claimed that he was so good. He broke into <a href=\"..\/..\/titans-tower\/34-55705\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Titans Tower<\/a> wearing his Robin costume (with few modifications). Jason delayed the other Titans and would engage in a battle with Tim. Jason had been angered that someone replaced him, and that he used to be a temporary Titan, yet they did not have a statue of him in the Hall of Fallen Titans. He beats Tim but did not kill him. Instead he rips the \"R\" symbol off his chest and leaves.<\/p><h3>Infinite Crisis<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-166246\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/308\/166246-173610-tim-drake.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/308\/166246-173610-tim-drake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-166246\"><img alt=\"Robin, a fugitive?\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/308\/166246-173610-tim-drake.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/308\/166246-173610-tim-drake.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Robin, a fugitive?\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/308\/166246-173610-tim-drake.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/308\/166246-173610-tim-drake.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Robin, a fugitive?<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Robin aided all the heroes during Infinite Crisis and helped a few teams battle Superboy-Prime. Tim later was able to find a cure for Superboy in one of Luthor\u2019s genetic research base. After Bl\u00fcdhaven\u2019s destruction, Robin led a team to help rescue those that were caught in the middle. However, the heroes were kicked out of the city by the government.<\/p><p>After the events of infinite crisis in which <a href=\"..\/..\/dick-grayson\/29-1691\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightwing<\/a> was nearly killed, Bruce takes Tim and Dick on the training trip he went on to become Batman. On the trip the training was brutal, they we\u2019re trained in ancient martial arts and furthered their skills in the ones they have already mastered. Tim also modified his Robin suit, the suit was a tribute to his dead best friend Superboy and took on some of the designs of Batman\u2019s suit.<\/p><h3>One Year Later<\/h3><p>After the <a href=\"..\/..\/one-year-later\/39-40777\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">year-long trip<\/a> with Bruce and Dick, Tim returns to Gotham and moves into the Wayne estate, gesturing a healthy relationship towards Bruce.

Shocked at first, Tim un-masks the woman and finds that it's Lynx, a hired assassin. Before Gotham's police arrive on the scene, Tim takes the mask in hopes of finding out who is trying to frame Batgirl. Whilst running tests on the mask at <a href=\"..\/..\/wikid\/wayne-manor\/34-55767\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wayne Manor<\/a>, <a href=\"..\/..\/wikid\/lady-shiva\/29-2222\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lady Shiva<\/a> arrives to inform Tim of the recent death of <a href=\"..\/..\/wikid\/nyssa\/29-41476\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nyssa al Ghul<\/a>, leaving the <a href=\"..\/..\/wikid\/league-of-assassins\/65-9591\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">League of Assassins<\/a> up for grabs. Tim focuses on his investigation, vowing not to let another person close to him die. He finds a clue in Batgirl's cowl written in a specific code. After deciphering it Robin's next objective is with Cassandra's father, <a href=\"..\/..\/wikid\/david-cain\/29-10482\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Cain<\/a>. Robin abides by what the code asks of him, and breaks David out of <a href=\"..\/..\/wikid\/blackgate-penitentiary\/34-56051\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blackgate Prison<\/a>. David informs Tim that his daughter is head of the League of Assassins. Tim, skeptical at first, finds out the truth after he confronts Cassandra.<\/p><p>Cassandra believes that she is meant to be a killer, and asks Tim to join her. Tim refuses as Cassandra shoots her father, apparently killing him. Tim then becomes hellbent in bringing Cassandra to the police. Tim single handily defeats all of her league League of Assassins ninja\u2019s before an explosion interrupts the battle. When Tim returns to the scene, he finds Cassandra's league to be dead, and his mini-camera still intact, which recorded everything. Tim notices David Cain managed to get away in the recording, and is able to clear his name from the footage.<\/p><p>Bruce also eventually adopts Tim, which Tim accepts.

He also keeps Conner's costume similar to how Batman grieved the death of Jason Todd.<\/p><p>Wonder Girl returns to the team full time, and goes in search of Robin to inform him of her decision. During the search, she discovers his secret lab. Tim confesses how much he misses Conner, and the two share a passionate, unexpected kiss.

Tim managed to escape and inject Cassandra with an antidote he developed in case Slade ever managed to re-inject Rose. With Batgirl now free of Slade's influence, she joined Robin and the Titans against Slade's Titans East.<\/p><p>Along with <a href=\"..\/..\/duela-dent\/29-5939\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duela Dent<\/a> and past Titans, Nightwing, Donna Troy, Beast Boy and Flash (Bart Allen), the Titans defeat the Titans East, although Slade and Inertia manage to escape. Batgirl, who attempted to murder Slade in revenge, is stopped by Nightwing and disappears soon after.<\/p><p>Since then, the Titans have experienced a bit of a rough patch. The introduction of the <a href=\"..\/..\/terror-titans\/65-51585\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terror Titans<\/a> withdrew Ravenger from their ranks, and soon after, one of the teams tech-twins was murdered in an attack on Wonder Girl. the team did however regain an alliance with <a href=\"..\/..\/bombshell\/29-41796\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bombshell<\/a>, and <a href=\"..\/..\/blue-beetle\/29-4438\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blue Beetle<\/a> has become a permanent member.

In the midst of a battle with Ra's ninjas, he breaks off and goes after the <a href=\"..\/..\/white-ghost\/29-49225\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Ghost<\/a>, feeling it to be selfish of him to deny his parents and friends life. The White Ghost tells Tim that he can restore them, but only if Tim swears his undying loyalty to Ra's al Ghul and forsakes Batman. Tim agrees, and is sent to a chamber with a <a href=\"..\/..\/lazarus-pit\/18-40817\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lazarus Pit<\/a>. There he is confronted by Nightwing, who swears to stop him. The two battle and Nightwing convinces Robin not to join Ra's. Tim and the others battled Ra's al Ghul at <a href=\"..\/..\/nanda-parbat\/34-41464\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nanda Parbat<\/a>.

In the end, he managed to make it to the scene just in time to witness Batman's apparent demise.<\/p><p>When Batman disappeared with no real explanation or trace, Robin knew it was his time to step into Gotham's spotlight. With the help of the recently returned Spoiler (who's death was faked in an earlier Batman Story Arc), Robin took on the gangs and villains of the city in an attempt to fill the void Batman left behind. He forged an alliance with a GCPD <a href=\"..\/..\/officer-harper\/29-51360\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sgt. Harper<\/a>.

On top of the growing crime problem, the assassin known as the Scarab returned with her sights on Robin, and two different people claiming to be Jason Todd's known alter-egos. Red Hood and <a href=\"..\/..\/red-robin\/29-40197\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Robin<\/a> were both revealed to have a part in the recent crime upheaval. Further shocking news came when Robin discovered that Spoiler was making deals with criminals behind Tim's back, including hiring Scarab to try and kill him. This revelation further revealed that Spoiler had orders from Batman to make sure Tim didn't find him, and to help him step up in the ranks of Super heroism.<\/p><p>Tim later found out that <a href=\"..\/..\/anarky\/29-10697\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anarky<\/a>, a villain turned hero, was behind much of the chaos the city had been experiencing, including the gangs and the appearance of Red Robin (Anarky was the person pretending to be Red Robin). However, Robin didn't realize this until he was almost killed in one of Anarky's explosions. Tim escaped with serious burns to his body and the back of his head, the latter forcing him to ditch his usual domino mask and debut with the Red Robin cape and cowl that he had apprehended.<\/p><p>Before Tim reentered the chaos, he did some research and discovered that the Anarky he was facing was an impostor.Tim found the impostor Anarky in the middle of the chaos, and in a last ditch attempt to save his city, Robin starts to fight with Anarky while Spoiler tries to stop the chaos and Anarky's bombs. Anarky tries to distract Tim with pre-recorded speech's of himself but this didn't work Anarky was no match for Tim's fighting skills and Tim beat Anarky badly. Tim had planned for Officer Jamie Harper get Ulysses's parents to come to try and stop Anarky, but he did not count on them bringing their other younger children (Hillary and Matthew). Anarky sees his parents, but not his brother and sister (neither does Robin). He manages to set off his last bomb which is in a mail box next to the car his younger brother and sister were in.<\/p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1390985\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59958\/1390985-94.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.65295629820051\" data-width=\"389\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 389px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59958\/1390985-94.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1390985\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/59958\/1390985-94.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59958\/1390985-94.jpg 389w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/59958\/1390985-94.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/59958\/1390985-94.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/59958\/1390985-94.jpg 389w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/59958\/1390985-94.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Robin saves officer Harper but did not know about the children in the car, and was not able to save them. With the chaos stopped, Robin has a brief talk with <a href=\"..\/..\/james-gordon\/29-3727\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Commissioner Gordon<\/a> in which Gordon questions Tim decision to bring Ulysses's parents into it. Tim meets up with Stephanie and tells her that he knows about her and Batman's plans to make him better and that he loves her. And because of that he can't have Spoiler around messing things up any more, he then congratulates her on making him better.<\/p><p>Two weeks later, with his burns healed and looking normal again, Tim pays Jason a visit in prison. Tim tells Jason the JLA teleport code that he and Dick had hacked so that Jason could have one last chance. Jim Gordon decides it is time to move forward and makes Robin Gotham's new protector, even giving him his own Robin Signal [much like the Bat-signal]. Gotham has a new protector, and his name is Robin.<\/p><p>Some short time after this Tim contacted the GCPD and advised them to change the Robin Signal back to the Bat-Signal to convince the city that Batman was still around. This signal was used to summon Tim to the GCPD by newly promoted Detective Specialist Harper. Harper gives Robin a note indicating that \"Robin Dies at Dawn\". Tim deduces that the note, addressed to \"Little Bird\", could only be from Lady Shiva, and that she is calling him out perhaps as a test to see if Tim can handle the burden of Gotham alone.<\/p><p>He returns to the Batcave where Jason Todd, whom Tim helped escape from jail, arrives to listen to a message that Bruce left for him as sort of a last will. Tim then spends the evening making a few phone calls, as he expects to die at the hands of Shiva. He calls Zoanne and breaks up with her over the phone, Ives just to be able to laugh. Finally he calls Stephanie to tell her how sorry he is, but she doesn't answer and he doesn't leave a message.<\/p><p>He then travels to the Gotham Church of the Holy Spirit, the only place in Gotham that has a statue that is the closest match to a statue of St. Germaine in Paris, where he met Lady Shiva for the first time arriving twenty minutes before the assassin does. When he asks her why she called him out, she replies that it is his presumption, and then she attacks. In the first blow she breaks three of Tim's ribs, however she falls over and collapses.<\/p><p>Tim then tells her that it is only presumption if he can't protect Gotham. She along with others trained him to fight smarter, not to his size or his experience, but his intelligence and that he has just proven he can. Tim tells Shiva he knew she was coming before she even left Hong Kong, and that while she is the deadliest assassin in the world, she is human first. It is because of this that she could not resist the chocolate he had delivered to her hotel room the night before. Chocolate that had been laced with a heart rate activated paralytic poison.

They have developed the <a href=\"..\/..\/batman-battle-for-the-cowl-the-network\/49-26323\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Network<\/a>, made up of their best allies to help. Robin and Squire tracked and was about to take down some robbers, but before they could take them down someone else does. Robin and Squire don't see the person, but he leaves them a note saying \" I AM BATMAN.\" Before anything else can be said, Nightwing call's Robin for back up with a gang, and they take the gang down. Meanwhile a coach full of Gotham's most dangerous criminal's was on their to Arkham, but the coach is stopped by a small army of goons lead by the Black Mask. After the criminals are off the coach, Arkham is blown up by Black Mask. They also have caught on that Batman is no longer around. Back in the Bat-cave Nightwing is looking at all of Batman's different suits when Tim walks in saying that one of them [Tim or Dick] needs to become the new Batman. Nightwing shrugs this off so Tim tells Dick about a man running around in a custom made Batman suit fighting crime, but this was no beginner. He was experienced and knew what he was doing.<\/p><p>Tim uses his brilliant detective skills to work out where the phony Batman's hideout is, but Tim decides not to confront the fake Batman as Robin but as Batman. He uses the silver age Batman suit.

Tim and Jason begin to fight with Tim obliviously the better fighter out of the two, but Jason uses his knowledge of his cave to lure Tim into a pit where he repeatedly slashes him with a Batarang. In the middle of the fight, Jason asks Tim to be his Robin, but Tim refuses and picks up a crowbar lying on the cave floor. He begins to beat Jason with it but, Jason manages to stab Tim in the gut with the Batarang and leaves him to die.<\/p><p>In the tunnels of Jason\u2019s cave, a wounded but a very much alive Tim Drake makes his way out of the tunnels. He reveals that he used a martial art technique called the possum reflex that Bruce taught him, the technique enables Tim to slow his heart rate to eight beats per minute. This reflex lead Jason to believe that he was dead, but Tim says that it was the Bat-suits heavy armor that saved him from the rusted Batarang. He says it was better to have several small cuts than one big one. He then thanks Bruce for teaching him the possum reflex and passes out. Jason sets off bombs he laid in his cave, and the explosions make all the tunnels cave in. Tim is too injured to move quickly, and the ground begins to collapse beneath him. Before he can fall to his death, Damian and Squire save him.<\/p><h3>Red Robin Begins - The Council of Spiders<\/h3><p>It is revealed that the Cowl went to Dick Grayson, and that he names Damien Wayne his Robin. Some time after this Tim confronts the new Batman in the Batcave. He expresses his anger to Dick at having his entire life burnt down, again. Dick tells Tim that \"Robin\" is the title of a protege' to the Batman, and that Tim is an equal and his closest ally. Also Dick says that if left alone Damien would kill someone. Damien enters the conversation wearing his Robin costume taunting Tim about having to upgrade security in the cave. Tim asks Dick how he can let Damien wear the mantle of Robin, how could he choose Damien over him. Damien continues, against Dick's warning, to taunt Tim calling him Drake, and telling him the Batgirl costume is available. Tim turns around and punches Damien to the ground and declares his name is Wayne. As Tim leaves, Dick says he still needs him. Tim returns to his room in Wayne Manor where he proceeds to trash the room in his fit of anger.<\/p><p>After he calms down Tim comes to the revelation that Bruce Wayne is alive and starts to plan to search for some clue, some evidence to prove this. When Tim vanishes, several people notice his absence, Zoanne, Ives, Jason Bard, and Detective Harper all indicate they have not heard from Tim or Robin in over a week. We learn that Tim is Working out of a warehouse, where he is ignoring calls from everyone, including Oracle and Wonder Girl. He begins work on the Red Robin costume, and as he is dressing he lashes out at a shadowed attacker kicking them in the stomach. He turns to find Spoiler who says she found him because she knows him. She knew that Tim had built a new command center because he thought Batman had gone crazy. Tim tells Stephanie that the fact that she knows about the hideout is even another reason he can not trust her, just like he can't trust her to wear the Spoiler costume. After Stephanie says she's worried and scared, Tim confronts her. He tells her that if she cared she'd have come to him, she wouldn't have lied to him, and she wouldn't have been spying on him for Dick. He tells her that if she cared she'd listen to him. He tells her not to follow him and leaves the warehouse.<\/p><p>Tim's next stop is the unmarked grave of Bruce Wayne. He stopped there because he needed someone to talk to. He's surprised that he is the only one who believes that Bruce is alive. That he'd be so alone. As he's talking Cassandra Sandsmark, aka Wonder Girl, arrives. Tim talks to her, telling her how it was his fault Anarchy's siblings died. He tells how he helped Jason Todd escape from prison, only to have him go on a murdering spree dressed as Batman. The deaths caused by Jason are on Tim's guilt as well. He tells Cassandra he doesn't know who he is anymore. He tells her that he had heard the Anti Life Equation during the Final Crisis, and that he can remember thinking there wasn't much he disagreed with in it. Cassie tells him that at one time Tim had told her \"Batman needs a Robin\" but what happens when Robin needs a Robin. Tim tells Cassie he thinks Bruce is alive. When Cassie shows no sign of believing him, Tim tells her it was a mistake to talk to her, and leaves. As she leaves, Cassie calls Dick Grayson.<\/p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2582514\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.84717868338558\" data-width=\"1276\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1276px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2582514\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg 1276w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg 1276w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/132053\/2582514-red_robin___10__01_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Tim, as Red Robin, stops at the edge of town. He had second thoughts filling his mind when Dick Grayson, as Batman, arrives to talk. Dick goes on to tell Tim they have had this talk before, that unlike Superman and Wonder Woman people like him, like Bruce, don't come back. He reminds Tim that Superman brought Bruce's body to them and they buried him. Tim turns to leave and Dick grabs his wrist. Tim tells Dick to let him go, and when Dick refuses, Tim judo throws him. they fight, proving to be evenly matched, dodge for dodge, blow for blow, block for block. As they fight Tim tells Dick he refuses to lose any more, he lost his parents, he lost Bruce, he lost being Robin, he lost Steph. He tells Dick he knows he's right and he's going to prove it. He throws three discs at Batman and as they are dodged he puts the Point of his Staff to Dick's throat. Tim tells Dick he's leaving, that Dick said they were equals, and that if he truly believes that, then he should believe in Tim. With that Tim leaves Gotham.<\/p><p>After finding nothing in Spain Tim travels to Paris, France, where within twenty minutes of arriving Tim stops a bank robbery and then is chased through the streets of Paris by a gang who he quickly takes down. Later that evening Tim is in his hotel room looking at his map but he is being spied on by a group assassins, that are employed by Ra\u2019s Al Gual.<\/p><p>The assassins request if they are aloud to kill Tim, which they get a reply of \u201cyou can try.\u201d One of the assassins then shoots a rocket into Tim\u2019s room and it explodes, thinking that the adopted son of Bruce Wayne is dead they begin to celebrate but are interrupted by a very much alive Red Robin.<\/p><p>Tim Drake and the assassins begin to fight and even though he is out numbered by the assassins [3 on 1] Tim is to much for them to handle taking out the shooter first. The only one of the that could match Tim is a tall black man who is good in martial arts. During the fight he learns their name\u2019s, the black man is called Z, the bald untrained woman is called Prudence [shorted to Pru] and the shooter Owens. Back in the fight Pru starts to get trigger happy and starts shooting uncontrollably even coming close to hitting Z. Tim dodges the bullets and then kicks her in the face, breaking her nose. Z suddenly gets a call from Ra\u2019s telling them to flee, they use flash grenades and manage to get away only leaving a communication device.<\/p><p>Meanwhile in Cape Town an assassin, from the league of assassins, has just taken out his target, but the assassin is killed by a mysterious being who leave\u2019s the assassin in a web.<\/p><p>Back in Berlin after the fight with the three assassins, Tim is sitting in a new hotel room and decides that finding Bruce is all that matter\u2019s and uses the communication device to call Ra\u2019s.<\/p><p>Later, Ra's lets Tim have three of his assassins; the three who attacked him earlier: Owens, Pru, and Z to help him search for clues of Batman. The Group ends up in an ancient cave wall, where inside Tim finds a familiar bat insignia drawn on it. Tim is relieved to know that he was right, but before he could celebrate even further, Z and Owens are killed by an unknown assassin who then slashes Pru's throat. Tim fights the mysterious assassin, but is then stabbed in the gut leaving him to die. Somehow, Tim manages to gain consciousness and uses his cape to stop most of the bleeding. He takes the wounded Pru back to the hotel. Before he can do anything else, Tim loses consciousness again because of blood loss. Meanwhile, Tam Fox, daughter of Lucius Fox, who was sent by her father to locate Tim, finds him in his hotel room. As she goes for the phone, Tim stops her, and the League of the Assassins come to take her, Pru, and Tim.<\/p><p>Tim then wakes up in Ra's lair next to a Lazarus Pit. He thinks he was brought back from the dead and fights the assassins near him. He then realizes he wasn't killed and just tore his stitches. Ra's informs him that he saved his life and asks Tim to help take down The League of Spiders, the same group that attacked Tim. Later he accepts to hunt down the group who attacked him (Before that happens Tim has his Blackest Night adventure). Eventually, this leads to a battle in which Tim fights against seven of the League of Spiders at one of Ra's hideouts while protecting Tam. While he manages to defeat them, Tim manages to break down the League of Assassins from the inside out as well. Afterward, Ra's contacts him and tells him that he will destroy everything the Wayne enterprise has built including his close friends and allies. Tim realize that Ra's is in Gotham City and rushes back there.<\/p><h3>Back in Gotham<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1387213\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5666666666667\" data-width=\"1290\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1290px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1387213\"><img alt=\"Tim back in Gotham City\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg 1290w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg 612w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg 408w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tim back in Gotham City\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg 1290w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg 612w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/66303\/1387213-scanned_image_4.jpg 408w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Tim back in Gotham City<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When he arrives at Gotham, Tim manages to apprehend Killer Moth while trying to keep a low profile from Dick.

They then make an emergency crash landing in a graveyard.<\/p><p>Dick opens the emergency hatch, only to find that suddenly a giant circus tent has appeared over half the graveyard.

Tim and Dick enter the circus tent, only to be swept up by the joy and happiness of seeing their parents again. They then see that both Black Lantern Captain Boomerang and Black Lantern <a href=\"\/anthony-zucco\/4005-22815\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22815\">Tony Zucco<\/a> have arrived and both Dick's parents and Tim's dad are reenacting their deaths. Both Tim and Dick are then filled with rage over seeing their parents murderers, both men then fly into a blind rage and began savagely beating their parents murderers.<\/p><p>While Tim and Dick are filled with rage, both Black Lantern Zucco and Black Lantern Boomerang try to rip out their hearts. Only to be stopped by Deadman (now in control of <a href=\"\/etrigan-the-demon\/4005-7367\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7367\">Etrigan the Demon<\/a>), who is bombarding them with hellfire. Tim and Dick then start to use their flamethrowers,which are beginning to run low. He then orders Damien to send him Mr. Freeze's freeze gun using Dick's glider. Dick asks Tim if he trusts him, while pointing the ice gun at him. Tim answers \"Do it\", Dick freeze's Tim and then freezes himself in order to throw off the Black Lanterns,who can no longer sense emotion from the two. After the all the Black Lanterns leave Deadman leaves Etrigan's body and enters Tim to bust him out of the ice. He then does the same with Dick. Dick, Deadman, and Tim look at the sky and think about their next move.<\/p><h3>The Hit List<\/h3><p>After the plot against the Bat-family, Tim Drake begins to feel that everything was just right, even Damian as Robin. He re-introduces himself to the Gotham crime scene by publicly taking out Lynx (who was possibly an undercover Hong Kong cop) and begins to set into motion his Hit List, composed of both villains and heroes who pose any danger.<\/p><p>Damian Wayne manages to hack Tim\u2019s account and sees himself among other heroes on the Hit List.<\/p><p>Robin joins Red Robin in one of his patrols and throws a 'R' shaped shuriken at Tim\u2019s grapple line intending to cause harm.

The boys return to the Batbunker and Damian reveals the \u2018truth\u2019 behind Tim\u2019s Hit List. Dick noticed that he wasn\u2019t among the heroes on the Hit List and Tim replies that he would never be. After Tim took down Lynx he went after two corrupt cops, Wise and Cavallo forcing them to hire Scarab which was what Tim was expecting.<\/p><p>Tim manages to lure Vicki Vale away from her apartment allowing him to sneak in and find out how much she knows, he sees her wall of photos and newspaper clippings of the Batfamily and linking their identities, he almost had to admire how well she had pieced everything.<\/p><p>He returns to the Batbunker and tells Alfred and Dick about Vicki\u2019s findings. Tim realizes that to lure Vicki away from the truth he would need a ruse that had long term effects, fitting in with his plan with Scarab.<\/p><p>Tim along with Tam Fox and her sister Tiffany visit Commissioner Gordon and states that he wants to hold a press conference for the reopening of a new community gym and also exposing Wise and Cavallo as corrupt cops.<\/p><p>Miss Martian, disguised as Tim Drake speaks at the press conference as Red Robin watches Scarab waiting for the right moment to shoot who she thinks is Tim Drake, preventing him from exposing the corrupt cops.

Paramedics arrive to take Tim Drake to Doctor Leslie Thompkins who know that Miss Martian was disguised as Tim. Doctor Thompkins releases false x-rays revealing that the bullet exited his body but his spine was damaged. Tim Drake will have to use crutches for a few months just to throw off Vicki Vale, showing his dedication to keep her from discovering the truth. Tim Drake holds another press conference and finally exposes the corrupt cops, the conference is broadcast on TV.<\/p><p>Elsewhere Ulysses Armstrong has Lonnie Machin in a machine trying to find out who Robin is and claiming that once he finds out who he is, he will \u201cdie in a blood-soaked night of total Anarky\u201d.<\/p><p>Anarky made a list of potential Robins, all around the same age and body type as Tim, sense then Anarky has been murdering them all one by one, crossing the candidates\/victims off his list, including Tim Drake\/Wayne whom was checked off earlier do to the public shooting that \"injured\" him, making it seem impossible for Tim and Robin to have once been one in the same. With the help of Lonni, a.k.a. MoneySpider, Tim is able to figure out Anarky's last target on the list. And just as Ulysses is ready to eliminate his target from behind, Red Robin makes a smashing entrance just in time to stop his foe. Thus leading to a fight that takes them out onto the streets. Tim tells Armstrong that \"This ends now,\" and that if he wants to blame him for the death of his brother and sister, he has to \"get in line\". After taking a short beating, Anarky tells Red Robin that he activated the explosives in the warehouse where Lonnie was being kept in coma and now only has sixty secants left. Tim ponders that thought of what mattered more, his hit list--someone who had killed so many and would kill again ... or a single life. But then Tim hits Anarky with a jolt to his vagus nerve which paralyzed Ulysses, though Tim knows he'll be gone before he can back. Red Robin soars off in attempt to save Lonnie before it is too late. He breaks through the warehouse window and finds Lonnie wired to machinery, with less then twenty-eight secants left, Tim has no time properly unhook Lonnie without knowing if it would kill him or not. The warehouse then goes up in flames after Tim gets himself and Lonnie out. Tim takes Lonnie to Leslie Thompkin where he is stabilized. While high above the city streets, over looking the apartment at which his father was murdered by Captain Boomerang, Tim sees a new family living there, a young couple and their kid...everything renewed. He swings off, thinking of how one by one he'd cut the cords to all the dark shadows that had been dragging him down, his own personal \"hit list\" he needed to check off, if only to realize that it would never end. Though, he could accept that, because \"even the best laid out plans don't always work out.\"<\/p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1317657\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25855\/1317657-rrob_15_dylux_1_copy.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5381165919283\" data-width=\"669\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 669px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25855\/1317657-rrob_15_dylux_1_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1317657\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/25855\/1317657-rrob_15_dylux_1_copy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25855\/1317657-rrob_15_dylux_1_copy.jpg 669w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/25855\/1317657-rrob_15_dylux_1_copy.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/25855\/1317657-rrob_15_dylux_1_copy.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/25855\/1317657-rrob_15_dylux_1_copy.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25855\/1317657-rrob_15_dylux_1_copy.jpg 669w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/25855\/1317657-rrob_15_dylux_1_copy.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/25855\/1317657-rrob_15_dylux_1_copy.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>But before Tim could take any steps further he decided he had to take one ugly step back. As Tim Drake\/Wayne, he goes to Iron Heights Prison, meeting with his father's killer. With only a wall of glass between them, Tim tells Harkness that the <a href=\"\/barry-allen\/4005-22804\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">Flash<\/a>, <a href=\"\/amanda-waller\/4005-4920\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4920\">Amanda Waller<\/a>, and the government's <a href=\"\/suicide-squad\/4060-40394\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40394\">Suicide Squad<\/a> should be the least of his concerns. Saying: \"None of them can hurt you like i will if you ever get out (prison)\" Boomerang remains silent with an evil grin that is quickly fades as Tim walks away telling him, \"You took my father from me. Think about what someone who now has the last name 'Wayne\" can take from you...\" The reason for the visit and \"tough guy\" display, all revolving around a plan that will soon make Captain Boomerang just another check off Tim's list.<\/p><p>In the final issue of Red Robin (#26), Tim was seen fighting Captain Boomerang, after setting the villain up to make all the wrong choices so Mr. Freeze could kill him for Tim. But when Harkness and Mr. Freeze were going to fight, Tim activated his failsafe plan in case of anything unexpected happening and saved Harkness from Fries. He tells Harkness to run, then swinging after him after he took care of Fries, thinking \"I couldn't go through with it. I couldn't let someone else kill him...and I couldn't let him kill himself.\" He came to a conclusion that he needed to kill Captain Boomerang himself, and proceeded to attack him. But when Harkness tripped off the building they were on, Tim caught him with a grapple line and turns him in instead of letting him fall to the ground to his death.<\/p><p>Dick (as Batman) accompanied by Robin confronted Tim about his actions, praising him that he didn't let the temptation of letting the man kill his father get to him. Right after the new Dynamic Duo left, Bruce came out of the shadows, telling Tim that he knew what Tim did. Tim said bitterly that he saved Harkness, so he made the right choice. And Bruce replied by saying \"Only after making all the wrong ones\".<\/p><p>Tim then said that he was who he was now, who his father and Bruce shaped him to be. Bruce the told him, \"You saved him tonight, Tim...But what about tomorrow...?\" and left Tim standing alone.

Tim Drake has to protect the Mayor by defeating the Society, however since Tim doesn't know where their leader is he can't stop their plans from the root. Bruce helps by disguising himself as a villain in their team so that he can find out who the next target is. It turns out the mayor was never the target, he was just bait to lead out Red Robin to stop him. Red Robin is the target.

Celine, still struggling to accept her powers, decided to retreat back to her room, while the rest of the Titans suits up and go with Tim to Time Square.<\/p><p>Despite team work, the Teen Titans ultimately lose their confrontation with Superboy.

They exchange information on Cassandra Sandsmark whom Jason calls a grifter who is in over her head and Tim tells Jason of smugglers coming in off the coast of Miami but no one knows what their cargo is. As Jason goes to leave, Tim stops him asking him to join him for breakfast. Jason gives in and they have fun talking about the past while joking about Alfred's cooking.<\/p><h3>Batman and Robin<\/h3><p>While all gathered to have a portrait commissioned of the Bat-Family, Tim and Damian once again clash. Damian decides that he will prove once and for all that his his the best robin. He will attack each of them and take something of theirs as a souvenir. Tim confronts Damian in the Bat-Cave. Damian throws in Tim's face how he was unable to save Artemis and how he almost went to far with his overreaction.<\/p><h3>Death of the Family<\/h3><p>Tim returns to Gotham City and reunites with the rest of \"the family\" in time to help them neutralize the toxin the Joker released into the water.

He is later kidnapped by the Joker and forced to fight Jason in order to save their \"fathers\", however he is able to deduce they are not their real fathers. Unfortunately the Joker was one step ahead and the boys were defeated, falling unconscious into a cave. Tim went back to the Teen Titans and where in New York on a boat cruise with the gang and after the events that happened with the Joker and the Batman Family. Tim Drake was poisoned somthing inside his body at the last pages of the series he was seen laughing when he took control of the boat and his friends did not see this happen they where a sleeping on the boat. The Joker did something to him and Jason Todd and to the others that we will find out in series to come. The Joker made it appear that he had cut off their faces, as well as those of Dick, Barbara and Damian, and had Batman tied up as well. In reality he had not, and the Joker tried to prove to the Bat family that Batman loved him more than he loved them. After Batman defeated the Joker, the relationships between Bruce and the rest of the Bat Family were still strong, but strained from what Joker had said.<\/p><h3>Batman Eternal<\/h3><p>Red Robin is investigating a nanobot plague affecting children in the Narrows part of Gotham. One of the children affected is <a href=\"\/cullen-row\/4005-85034\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85034\">Cullen Row<\/a>, which draws Harper Row into action. Red Robin does not welcome her help and wants her to stay safe, but she impresses him with her computer skills, even hacking into his personal, hi-tech computer. After Harper sneaks onto his plane and follows him to Asia, Red Robin and Harper continue to look for information on the nanobots, now reluctantly working together. After tracing the nanobots back to <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/mad-hatter\/4005-5814\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5814\">Jervis Tetch<\/a>, the Mad Hatter, he forces Harper to stay behind.

After this battle, he checks in on his new friend Harper, and is introduced to his one-time love, Stephanie Brown.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h2>Skills and Abilities<\/h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1519283\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1519283-486148_rb_160_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1519283-486148_rb_160_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1519283\"><img alt=\"Master Combatant\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1519283-486148_rb_160_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1519283-486148_rb_160_super.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1519283-486148_rb_160_super.jpg 426w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Master Combatant\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1519283-486148_rb_160_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1519283-486148_rb_160_super.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1519283-486148_rb_160_super.jpg 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Master Combatant<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Tim has undergone advanced training in many martial arts. He has mastered many unarmed styles of fighting, including Leopard kung fu, Savate, Judo, capoeria, karate, dragon Kung Fu and Biangan .Tim was taught these arts by Batman, Nightwing and Lady Shiva. Tim's fighting style is less acrobatic than Dick's, but more unpredictable and fluid than Bruce's. He is one of the three people in the world to have mastered the deadly martial art technique of <i>Leopard Blow<\/i>; the other two being Batman and Lady Shiva.<\/p><p>While he is a very competent unarmed fighter, Tim uses a bo as his primary weapon and usually engages his opponents using the art of Bojutsu -- or <i>staff technique<\/i>. He is so skilled with the bo that he once defeated Lady Shiva in a sparring match, and has been known to be able to take on multiple enemies at once.<\/p><p>Tim is in prime physical condition for a young man his age. He trains constantly with Bruce and Dick and continually seeks to hone his skills. Tim is accomplished in the acrobatic arts, though not as skilled as Dick, and has mastered the arts of escapology and stealth.Tim is also very fluent in several languages such as , Japanese, Mandarin, German, English, Russian and French.<\/p><p>Tim possesses a genius-level intellect. He is an exceptional detective, having deduced the identities of both Bruce and Dick when he was just a young boy after watching Dick as Robin perform a move he saw him doing in the circus. Batman himself said that Tim may be a better detective than him. His high level of intelligence makes Tim a natural student and self-taught practitioner of many disciplines. He has studied computer science and is a highly skilled programmer and hacker. He has an in-depth knowledge of the natural sciences, which he puts to use in the crime lab; the extent of his expertise was illustrated when he made an attempt to re-clone his best friend, <a href=\"..\/..\/superboy\/29-1686\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conner Kent<\/a>, after his death. He has studied the behavioral sciences, specifically criminology, and is very well-read and literate.<\/p><h2>Personality<\/h2><p>Throughout his life, Tim Drake has gone through a number of events that have altered his personality. Though Tim has always been a serious child, a number of events he had experienced has only intensified his already serious nature. A once balanced child was turned into a dark man. Before becoming Robin, he had built up a good life for himself and good friends with people he could trust, even his father has accepted what he was doing with his life. he was friendly and likeable that he had been able to enjoy life. He cares about innocent people, and would never stand by and watch someone be hurt or killed. He has a strong moral compass.<\/p><h2>Weaponry and Gadgets<\/h2><p>Tim carries a gear load out similar to that of Batman and Nightwing.<\/p><h3>Weaponry<\/h3><ul><li><b>Bo<\/b>: a custom-made, retractable bo staff that serves as Tim's primary weapon. The bo has small holes drilled in either end to create a whistling effect when wielded, which disorients opponents and keeps them off guard. It can deploy a basic shield at the touch of a button, and contains a retractable blade at the top, effectively making it a spear when needed.<\/li><li><b>Batarang, throwing discs and 'R'-shurikens<\/b>: offensive weapons that can be thrown as projectiles or boomerangs.<\/li><li><b>Bolas<\/b>: cords with weighted ends designed to ensnare opponents when throwing in a gyrating motion. These bolas can emit an electric shock if needed.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Gadgets<\/h3><ul><li><b>Grappling gun<\/b>: a sidearm that fires a projectile with a metal-laced paracord attached to it. The projectile is meant to latch on to a surface so that the user can either swing, climb the rope or retract the rope very rapidly, pulling the user toward the hooked surface. But can be used to pull someone to you.<\/li><li><b>Cuffs<\/b>: handcuffs and zip-cuffs used to contain criminals.<\/li><li><b>Tracking devices<\/b>: miniature devices that connect to WayneTech satellites planted on people or objects to track their location.<\/li><li><b>Communications device<\/b>: a small device designed to sit in the outer ear canal that maintains an open line of communication between Tim and other heroes in the field, Alfred, <a href=\"..\/..\/barbara-gordon\/29-5368\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oracle<\/a> and <a href=\"..\/..\/anarky\/29-10697\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lonnie Machin<\/a>.<\/li><li><b>First aid kits<\/b>: used to administer to the wounded or to temporary heal injuries to his own body.<\/li><li><b>Gas mask and re-breather<\/b>: devices used to aid breathing in hostile environments or underwater.<\/li><li><b>Plasma torch<\/b>: a cutting torch used to 'slice' through metal.<\/li><li><b>Lock picking tools<\/b>: a set of tools used to gain entry into otherwise inaccessible areas.<\/li><li><b>Micro-camera<\/b>: a small camera primarily used to collect photographic evidence.<\/li><li><b>Micro-computer<\/b>: a small fully-functional computer.<\/li><li><b>Cryptographic sequencer<\/b>: a peripheral device used to aid in hacking and decoding cyphers.<\/li><li><b>Explosive pellets<\/b>: miniature explosives that can be used offensively, but are primarily used to aid in escapes.<\/li><li><b>Smoke pellets<\/b>: miniature explosives that create a smoke screen for the user and disorientate targets.<\/li><li><b>Flashbangs<\/b>: small explosive devices that create a blinding flash and an ear-piercing bang; used to seriously disorientate and\/or incapacitate opponents.<\/li><li><b>Plastic explosive<\/b>: sticky explosives that are used to destroy structures. As shown in recent Batman Arkham games.<\/li><li><b>Taser<\/b>: a device used to deliver an intense electric shock to an opponent in emergency situations.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Costumes<\/h2><h3>First Robin Costume<\/h3><p>Tim's early costume was designed with functionality in mind; more so than Dick's and Jason's. Instead of a tunic, Tim wore a red bulletproof singlet with green short-sleeves, yellow straps and the 'R' symbol, which could double as an emergency shuriken, emblazoned on his chest. He wore green leggings, presumably made of Nomex, and green gloves. The pixie boots that Dick and Jason once wore were replaced by much more practical footwear: Jika-Tabi style boots, which allow Tim a greater degree of stealth and agility. The outfit was made complete by a black and yellow cape, noticeably longer than the other Robin's, which Tim often shrouded himself in just like his mentor and a green mask that covered his eye area and provided lensing. He carried his gear in a light, golden-yellow utility belt; most devices were stored in small container-like devices that adorned the belt. He carried his retractable bo as his primary weapon, which attached to the back of the belt.<\/p><h3>Second Robin Costume<\/h3><figure data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-279023\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13344\/279023-144737-robin.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3392857142857\" data-width=\"112\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 112px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13344\/279023-144737-robin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-279023\"><img alt=\"Second Robin Costume\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" data-width=\"112\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13344\/279023-144737-robin.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13344\/279023-144737-robin.jpg 112w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Second Robin Costume\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13344\/279023-144737-robin.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13344\/279023-144737-robin.jpg 112w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px\" data-width=\"112\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Second Robin Costume<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After the death of <a href=\"..\/..\/superboy\/29-1686\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conner Kent<\/a> in Infinite Crisis, Tim, deeply affected by the loss of his best friend, redesigned his costume to more closely resemble the red and black color scheme of the late Superboy. This was done by eliminating the green elements from the costume entirely; Tim wore an all red Nomex bodysuit with three yellow straps across the chest, and black trunks, gloves and lightweight boots. The 'R' symbol remained on the upper left of the chest. The black and yellow cape, the top of which acted as a collar surrounding and protecting his neck, remained.

The costume consisted of a bulletproof, long-sleeved, red tunic with two bandolier style straps crossing over his chest, and the Red Robin symbol encircled at the center. He wore black Nomex leg stockings and black boots and leather gloves. He still carried most of his gear in a pouched utility belt and kept using the bo staff as his primary weapon. Tim replaced the mask with a cowl, which attached to an all black cape, similar to Batman's.<\/p><h3>Second Red Robin Costume<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1502851\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/68486\/1502851-td_rr_rooftop.png\" data-ratio=\"2.6781914893617\" data-width=\"376\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 376px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:267.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/68486\/1502851-td_rr_rooftop.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1502851\"><img alt=\"Second Red Robin Costume\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px\" data-width=\"238\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/68486\/1502851-td_rr_rooftop.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/68486\/1502851-td_rr_rooftop.png 376w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/68486\/1502851-td_rr_rooftop.png 358w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/68486\/1502851-td_rr_rooftop.png 238w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Second Red Robin Costume\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/68486\/1502851-td_rr_rooftop.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/68486\/1502851-td_rr_rooftop.png 376w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/68486\/1502851-td_rr_rooftop.png 358w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/68486\/1502851-td_rr_rooftop.png 238w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px\" data-width=\"238\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Second Red Robin Costume<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Upon Tim's return to Gotham, Alfred took the liberty of making some significant alterations to the Red Robin costume.

The leather gloves were replaced by lightweight black gloves underneath two black, armored wrist gauntlets. The bandoliers were left intact along with the Red Robin symbol in the center of the chest. The cowl was made lighter and more streamlined, while the traditional cloth cape was replaced by a para-cape. Tim continues to wear a golden, pouched utility belt to bear his load-out and bo staff.

The suit is functionally similar to the original, but with more detailing and a Red Robin double \"R\" logo replacing the traditional Robin logo.<\/p><h2>Relationships with His Adopted Brothers<\/h2><h3>Tim and Dick<\/h3><p>Dick and Tim have a close brotherly bond. Dick was the only person who supported Tim when he wanted to become Robin. Dick helped Tim ease into the role and helped him with Bruce\u2019s distant manner. Dick treats Tim as a little brother, They make a brilliant crime fighting team, their tight bond started when Bruce broke his back. Although Azreal was originally chosen to take the mantle, after difficulties with him Bruce gave the mantle to the man who should have gotten it in the first place Dick Grayson, the brotherly bond flourishes.<\/p><p>Dick is very protective over him. After the Joker pretended to kill Tim, Nightwing went out on a personal vendetta to catch the Joker. When he took down the Joker\u2019s criminal army in a fit of rage he beat the Joker to death with his bare hands and didn't stop until he saw that Tim was still very much alive, the joker is resuscitated [brought back to life] by huntress [the joker is still alive]. In the Resurrection of Ra\u2019s Al Ghul story arc, Tim wanted to use the Lazarus pit to bring back his father, Spoiler and Superboy. Tim and Nightwing spar; Nightwing was holding back, because he was only trying to calm Tim down from making a misguided decision, while Tim was emotional and angry at the loss of his loved ones. I-Ching steps in and spars with both, and is clearly a better martial artist than either, as he is apparently holding back as well.<\/p><p>Dick gave Tim the option of taking samples from the pit, but at the last second he decides against it and collapses to the floor. Dick catches him and cradles him. The two are still extremely close and whenever Tim is in trouble or has problems with Bruce he always seems to go to Dick. The two are now officially brothers. Bruce adopted Tim after his father died. From Batman: Battle for the Cowl to the Red Robin story arc Collision Dick and Tim's bond was somewhat shaken by the apparent \"death\" of Bruce and Dick becoming Batman while also making Damian the fifth Robin. Tim resents the fact that he has been 'replaced' by a homicidal child, but Dick explains that he views Tim as a partner and an equal, not a sidekick and that he chose Damian as the new Robin to keep an eye on him and keep him from killing again. Dick also shows concern over Tim's obsession with the possibility of Bruce's survival and is very reluctant to let Tim leave Gotham but they later reconcile when Tim returns home with both proof that Bruce has survived and <em>Ra's Al Ghul<\/em> preparing to launch an attack on the Batman family.<\/p><h3>Tim and Jason<\/h3><p>Tim and Jason have a hatred for each other. When Jason returned during the Hush storyline he managed to get behind Tim and questioned Bruce's decision of replacing him with a 'pretender'.<\/p><p>Jason would later break into the Titan's Tower and sees that there wasn't a statue of him in memorial even though he was a Teen Titan although for a brief time. Angered that he didn't get a statue, Jason and Tim fight. Jason manages to beat Tim and leaves the message \"Jason Todd was here\" written in Tim's blood. Afterward, Jason does admit that Tim is good and begins a begrudging respect for the new boy wonder.<\/p><p>During the absence of Batman, Tim encounters Jason, now as Red Hood while dealing with a gang and a person donning the Red Robin costume During the fight, Jason was shot in the leg and was arrested by the police. Sometime later, Tim Drake helped Jason get out of jail because he knew that it was what Bruce would have wanted. Jason is let back into the cave to listen to a final message left by Bruce. Helping Jason out of jail seemed to improve their relationship.<\/p><p>However it would not last, as Jason would shortly after begin attacking and murdering criminals while dressed as Batman. Tim would be the first to discover the identity of this new murderous \"Batman\" and attack him in his lair. During which Tim beats Jason with a crowbar, while Jason stabs him with a batarang and leaves Tim to die in an explosion.<\/p><p>In DC's New 52, Tim and Jason's relationship has greatly improved. After leaving Gotham, Tim and Jason provide information for each other and Tim convinces Jason to have breakfast with him, beginning to see each other more like brothers as seen when they were trapped by the Joker and when they worked together during Batman Eternal. The two boys enjoy teasing each other as Tim has become the brother who Jason is most comfortable with.<\/p><h3>Tim and Damian<\/h3><p>Tim and Damian share an antagonistic relationship and an intense loathing of each other, fighting on a number of occasions. On their very first meeting, Tim attempted to make friends with the angry and violent Damian but Damian threatened him, thinking that Tim had usurped his position as Batman's son and later fights him in an attempt to replace him as Batman's partner, nearly killing Tim in the process. Later when Damian's life has come under threat from his grandfather <em>Ra's Al Ghul<\/em>, Tim attacks him under the belief that Damian has come to kill him and Alfred, and during the events of Battle for the Cowl, Damian reluctantly saves Tim's life after being critically wounded in a fight with Jason Todd.<\/p><p>When Dick assumes the mantle of Batman, he selects Damian to be his Robin instead of Tim and Damian gloats and flaunts his new position and costume in front of Tim at every opportunity. It is with Damian's mocking suggestion that Tim start using the Batgirl costume that causes Tim to snap and punch him in the face, later leaving Gotham with the Red Robin costume on a quest to prove Bruce's survival. Before he left town, Tim requested to Dick that Dick not let Damian destroy the legacy of Robin that he and Tim had built. And even after Tim's return to Gotham some months later, Damian still continues to insult and threaten Tim's life at every chance, even though Tim stated he has always held back, and then he engages in battle again,easily defeating Damian.<\/p><h2>Alternate Versions<\/h2><h3>Batman: Tim Drake<\/h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1615452\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1615452-9355_400x600.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1615452-9355_400x600.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1615452\"><img alt=\"Titan's of a Dark Tomorrow\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1615452-9355_400x600.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1615452-9355_400x600.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Titan's of a Dark Tomorrow\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1615452-9355_400x600.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1615452-9355_400x600.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Titan's of a Dark Tomorrow<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Captured in Teen Titans: #17-19, 51-53.

The Teen Titans of the past met their older more violent selves and they found out about a great crisis that killed many heroes including the original Batman - Bruce Wayne. Older Tim Drake told his younger self that Dick refused to be the next Batman and retired after the crisis had passed. The crisis was caused by the Teen Titans leaving one another, and them not ever trusting each other.<\/p><p>As Tim Drake and his past Teen Titans are in this dark future, the older Tim Drake is the leader of Titans East; which was a team of \"so-called\" good heroes. And the other side is Titan's West which are really the noble team, however at odds with Titan's East tyranny. At this time Tim Drake told his Titans that they would have a zero tolerance against criminals - all and any criminals that didn't obey the law were put to death. Years later, the Joker's daughter <a href=\"..\/..\/duela-dent\/29-5939\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duela Dent<\/a> tried to meet her real father, <a href=\"..\/..\/joker\/29-1702\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Joker<\/a>. When Duela tried to prove that she was the daughter of the Joker, Joker wanted nothing to do with her.<\/p><p>Angered, Duela went out and tried to prove herself once more by killing certain retired heroes. Succeeding in killing the retired (<a href=\"..\/..\/batwoman\/29-9052\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batwoman<\/a>) Bette Kane, active Titan's member Cassandra Cain, and <a href=\"..\/..\/alfred\/29-5556\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alfred<\/a>, Tim Drake was extremely angry to hear this.

When younger Tim Drake heard about what his older self had done, they had a massive battle under Drake Manor (which had previously been Wayne manor) during which younger Tim managed to beat his older self. After all their alternate future selves had been defeated, Tim confronted his Titans and told them that they should disband. However,when they return the team stays together, spending more time together to build trust, altering that future.<\/p><h3>Futures End<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60461\/4093447-6331396204-red-r.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4093447\" data-ratio=\"1.048\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60461\/4093447-6331396204-red-r.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4093447\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" data-width=\"610\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60461\/4093447-6331396204-red-r.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60461\/4093447-6331396204-red-r.jpg 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60461\/4093447-6331396204-red-r.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/60461\/4093447-6331396204-red-r.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" data-width=\"610\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>In the potential future of Futures End, which takes place five years into the future of the current DC universe, the Teen Titans was killed in the war between Earth 1 and Earth 2.

The following episode, \"Sins of the Father\", reveals that Tim was a street kid whose father was a criminal who betrayed Two-Face and was ultimately killed. Feeling he needed to help, Tim stole the Robin suit and helped Batman take down Two-Face. Tim's background was almost identical to Jason Todd\u2019s, who was the second Robin in comic books, but was not used in the series. In the episode \"Growing Pains\", Tim\u2019s impulsive behavior and anger leads him to disobeying Batman and becomes inches away from destroying Clayface. He was voiced by Mathew Valencia in the series. Robin\u2019s costume in this series is very similar to Tim\u2019s second costume in the comics. It was discussed by Bruce Timm that he had mixed Tim Drakes origin with Jason Todd.<\/p><h4>Static Shock<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4783541-7487924527-e94c5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4783541\" data-ratio=\"0.74\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4783541-7487924527-e94c5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4783541\"><img alt=\"Robin in Static Shock\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4783541-7487924527-e94c5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4783541-7487924527-e94c5.jpg 500w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4783541-7487924527-e94c5.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4783541-7487924527-e94c5.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Robin in Static Shock\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4783541-7487924527-e94c5.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/113509\/4783541-7487924527-e94c5.jpg 500w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/113509\/4783541-7487924527-e94c5.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/113509\/4783541-7487924527-e94c5.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Robin in Static Shock<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Tim appeared in several episodes of <em><a href=\"\/static-shock\/4075-153\/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-153\">Static Shock<\/a><\/em>, voiced by Eli Marienthal and Shane Sweet.

But while it's certainly now geared towards keeping its wearer alive, there was a more basic reason for deviating from the brightly-hued suit worn by Robins past, according to Denny O'Neil, editor of the Batman titles.<\/p><p>\"It was a very dated costume\" he explains. \"We thought we could make it a little more modern, a little classier maybe, a little more appropriate to a teenager than to a little kid. Also, we did want an excuse to put the hi-tech stuff in. This is the age of computers, after all.<\/p><p>\"One of the problems with the old costume was that it wasn't really very practical for a dark, night character. One of Neal's inspirations was the reversible cape so you preserve the bright Robin motif, and yet, there's a certain logic to being able to cover up. And hell, school kids wear bulletproof vests these days. It seems to me that if I were in any kind of crime-fighting business, I would certainly want to do that. As for computer links, I really don't know what they are, but Elliot Brown, who did the technology part of this, assures us that they would work. I'm perfectly willing to take his word for it.<\/p><p>\"The new Robin costume will soon be seen on action figures, lunch boxes and other products in stores across the country as well as, DC hopes, on movie screens in Batman II. After all, with all its protective gear and built-in equipment, this battle-ready Robin appears to have taken his cue from the film's heavily armored Batman.<\/p><p>\"I don't know if it [the costume] was influenced [by the movie's],\" says O'Neil, \"but that probably played some part in the designer's thinking. We got about 15 different designs, and we, I swear, Scout's honor, liked this one the best. We sent them out to [Batman director] Tim Burton, and this was the one he liked best. So, it was a real consensus that this is the one we ought to go with. Some of the others were interesting, but we wanted to preserve the traditional Robin look and yet update it.\"<\/p><p>However, a reputation built up by others over a half-century was not something Tim Drake needed to inherit and so, given the task of furthering the latest Robin's training, writer Chuck Dixon, along with penciler Tom Lyle and inker Bob Smith, devised a five-issue \"Trial\" to make a man out of the Boy Wonder.<\/p><p>\"No matter who Robin is, he's generally considered just a sidekick,\" Dixon reasons, \"and I thought it would be challenging to deal with a sidekick as a primary character in a mini-series. And everybody seemed to have disliked Robin II so much that it was also a challenge to make a Robin people would like. Alan Grant had laid some great groundwork in Detective for Tim Drake to be a really neat character, and as I talked to Denny O'Neil and Dan Raspier, I got even more interested in the direction they wanted the mini-series to take, a coming-of-age story with lots of fistfights.<\/p><p>\"Tim Drake has a lot, of self-doubt whether or not he can fill Robin's shoes, whether he could be a competent sidekick for Batman.<\/p><p>\"He's not overconfident, which was obviously the problem with the previous Robin. He's not full of the wisecracks, although a transformation comes over him when he puts the costume on. He's pretty much a loner, which makes him match up with Batman. I always said Dick Grayson was much more sociable than Tim Drake. I mean, Dick Grayson, as they put him in college, was kind of hip. I don't think Tim Drake will ever be kind of hip. He's brainy, into computers, into books. He's like a really super-athletic nerd in many ways.<\/p><p>And just as his mentor once set off around the globe to complete his crime-fighting education, so too does the young hero take his leave of the United States to add to his own. \"It was John Lennon who said, 'Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans,' \" Dixon recalls. \"Robin plans to go to Paris to hone his martial arts skill and gain some confidence. And he never gets there. He begins to learn with the old master, that doesn't work out, and he immediately finds himself involved in a world-spanning conspiracy run by a knighted English nobleman who's also King Snake, dreaded Asian underworld figure. He becomes involved with a renegade Drug Enforcement Agency agent and Lady Shiva, and the three of them travel from France to Hong Kong, battling the King Snake and his hench-person Lynx, who I hope will be Robin's female nemesis, his Catwoman, along the way.\"<\/p><p>In the end, though, it matters little whether Tim Drake will be able to capture King Snake. It is the wandering attentions of readers he will have to arrest, and to Batman fans who've long taken his role for granted, he will need to prove that he is capable of supporting both his own title for a brief time and their interest over what DC would like to be many long years.<\/p><p>\"I really think he can,\" says Chuck Dixon. \"Robin had a run in Star-Spangled Comics back in the early '50s, and they were some really good stories, better than the Batman stories at the time. Robin as a character, and this Robin in particular, I think he's strong enough. Readers will get a kick out of him. He's no Hardy Boy.\"<\/p><p>\"We tried to build Tim Drake carefully from the ground up to make him likable and, within the confines of our art form, believable. We have a gut feeling that you get when you've been doing it for 25 years that he will be popular and that we'll probably do other mini-series,\" remarks Denny O'Neil. \"I think he'll certainly be more popular than Jason.<\/p><p>IGN also ranked Tim as the 32nd greatest comic book hero of all time.<\/p>","first_appeared_in_issue":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/first_appeared_in_issue\/4000-32089\/","id":32089,"name":"Year Three Part 1: Different Roads","issue_number":"436"},"gender":1,"id":9290,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/5357869-screen%20shot%202016-08-02%20at%2011.34.25%20pm.png","medium_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/5357869-screen%20shot%202016-08-02%20at%2011.34.25%20pm.png","screen_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/5357869-screen%20shot%202016-08-02%20at%2011.34.25%20pm.png","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/5357869-screen%20shot%202016-08-02%20at%2011.34.25%20pm.png","small_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/5357869-screen%20shot%202016-08-02%20at%2011.34.25%20pm.png","super_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/5357869-screen%20shot%202016-08-02%20at%2011.34.25%20pm.png","thumb_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/5357869-screen%20shot%202016-08-02%20at%2011.34.25%20pm.png","tiny_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/5357869-screen%20shot%202016-08-02%20at%2011.34.25%20pm.png","original_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/image\/original\/5357869-screen%20shot%202016-08-02%20at%2011.34.25%20pm.png","image_tags":"All Images"},"name":"Tim Drake","origin":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/origin\/4030-4\/","id":4,"name":"Human"},"publisher":{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/publisher\/4010-10\/","id":10,"name":"DC Comics"},"real_name":"Timothy Jackson Drake","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/tim-drake\/4005-9290\/","resource_type":"character"},{"aliases":"Red Hood\r\nRobin\r\nRed Robin\r\nBatman\r\nNightwing\r\nWingman\r\nJaybird\r\nArkham Knight","api_detail_url":"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/api\/character\/4005-6849\/","birth":"Aug 16, 1995","count_of_issue_appearances":1040,"date_added":"2008-06-06 11:27:41","date_last_updated":"2018-06-03 20:06:38","deck":"Jason Todd was the second Robin, but was brutally murdered by the Joker.

Eventually, Willis was sent to prison and never returned home despite earning his release after a few years. Thus before Willis got sent to prison was the last time Jason ever saw him. This left Jason with Catherine Todd, a drug addicted woman he did not know was not truly his biological mother. In order to survive and for his so-called mother's habit, Jason turned to crime, ripping off car parts for money. Catherine soon died from a drug overdose, and Willis had disappeared after screwing up a job for <a href=\"\/two-face\/4005-5555\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5555\">Two-Face<\/a>. Jason was left alone on the streets barely surviving, still stealing parts of cars for cash. This led to Batman discovering Jason in an alley stealing the tires off the <a href=\"\/batmobile\/4055-41463\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\">Batmobile<\/a>.<\/p><p>Bruce Wayne tried to put Jason in <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/ma-gunn\/4005-30350\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30350\">Ma Gunn's<\/a> school for troubled youths but Jason ran away from the school when he realized it was actually a front for criminal activity. With that option off the table, Bruce took him in as his own and began training him to replace Dick Grayson as Robin. He did not have Dick's cheerful enthusiasm or natural acrobatic skill, but life had made him tough and full of sarcastic wit which made Jason motivated. Secretly, Bruce believed that had he not taken Jason into his home then in a few years time he would be taking Jason in to the police as Batman. So instead, Jason became the new Robin.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Jason Todd was created by <a href=\"\/gerry-conway\/4040-40871\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40871\">Gerry Conway<\/a> and <a href=\"\/don-newton\/4040-31556\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-31556\">Don Newton<\/a> in 1983 under the editorial direction of <a href=\"\/len-wein\/4040-41457\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41457\">Len Wein<\/a>. The character was introduced to address the problem of Dick Grayson's absence from the Batman books due to that character's starring role in the <a href=\"\/the-new-teen-titans\/4050-3036\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3036\">Teen Titans<\/a> series. It was felt that Batman worked best with a partner to regularly interact with, which was a role that Dick could no longer fill. So Jason was introduced to fill the void Dick Grayson left until Jason's death happened eight years after he first appeared.<\/p><h2>Character History<\/h2><h3>Pre-Crisis: Earth-One<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1255271\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25855\/1255271-precrisis_jay.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.70833333333333\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25855\/1255271-precrisis_jay.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1255271\"><img alt=\"Robin II (Earth-One)\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/25855\/1255271-precrisis_jay.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/25855\/1255271-precrisis_jay.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/25855\/1255271-precrisis_jay.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Robin II (Earth-One)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Since Jason Todd was created to fill Dick Grayson's role, he was basically a carbon copy of a young Dick Grayson except with lighter hair. Jason Todd was a boy with light red hair, but very much like <a href=\"\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick Grayson<\/a> in personality. He was the son of Joseph and Trina Todd. While working on a case for Robin, then Dick Grayson.

He was now a punk rather than a circus performer. He smoked, was cynical and had a mean streak to him than Dick never had. He was an angrier Robin who would sometimes use excessive force on the more vile criminals.<\/p><p>In one notorious incident, a serial rapist named Felipe Garzonas dodged the charges for his crimes due to his father's diplomatic immunity. After one of his victims committed suicide, Jason headed straight for Felipe ahead of Batman. Batman arrived in time to witness Felipe falling from a building to his death, and Jason claimed only that Felipe got spooked and slipped when he showed up. Though Batman thought otherwise considering Jason can be a bit tough on the criminals.<\/p><p>The character's new attitude and origin was met with negative reactions from some very vocal fans. In a few years times, the fate of Jason would be put to a vote by the fans via a 1-900 phone number and published in the end of the <a href=\"\/batman-a-death-in-the-family\/4050-25187\/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-25187\">Batman: Death in the Family<\/a> limited series by <a href=\"\/jim-starlin\/4040-7922\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7922\">Jim Starlin<\/a>. Jason's death won the vote by a count of 5,343 to 5,271. However, O'Neil would later say that hundreds of fraudulent votes were cast for Jason's death by one person using a computer.<\/p><p>Jason Todd returned to Gotham City years after his death as an anti-hero\/antagonist to Batman using the identity Red Hood. Jason holds a grudge against Bruce for not killing the Joker and seeking revenge for Jason's death. He stood as a rejection of Batman's ideals, willing to use lethal force against criminals and control crime rather than fighting against it all.

Their paths crossed in <a href=\"\/gotham-city\/4020-23611\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City<\/a> as both journeys neared the end.

Over the next decade Jason's death haunted Batman, as much as his parents' death. As this event is considered to be the very few that has made an impact on Bruce's mentality and thoughts about the general concept of Robin<\/p><p>Leading up to the events that would ultimately end in Jason's death, he became more and more reckless in his actions. He began disobeying Batman's direct orders, as well as leaving himself open to being shot on a few occasions. When Batman tells Alfred he is considering making Jason take some time off, Jason interrupts, clearly angry and tells Bruce to talk to Alfred as he storms off. Jason walks towards his old neighborhood and comes across a family friend. While going through some contents he learns that Catherine Todd was not his mother. He also learns that his mother's name started with an \"S.\" He found three names in his Father's address book and looked for them on the Batcomputer. Thinking Batman wouldn't be interested in this sort of investigation, he takes off to go look for his mother. At the same time, the <a href=\"\/joker\/4005-1702\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker<\/a> was in the Middle East trying to hijack a nuclear warhead. Jason goes to the first woman, but she was not his mother. Batman, who was looking for both Jason and the Joker in the Middle East, finds Jason and helps him on his quest. The next name is actually world-renowned assassin <a href=\"\/lady-shiva\/4005-2222\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2222\">Lady Shiva<\/a>. Batman confronts and defeats her in combat and under the effects of truth serum she reveals that she is not Jason's mother either. Finally Jason finds his mother, Sheila Haywood, and all seems well. However the Joker knows Sheila had previously performed \"illegal operations on teenage girls\" in Gotham. After one resulted in the death of a teen, she was blacklisted as a medical practitioner. Joker uses this to blackmail her. When Batman has to go stop an incident he warns Jason not to go after his mother and the Joker, to wait for back-up. He disobeys Batman's orders once again and goes to confront his mother. He shows her that he is in fact Robin, and she tells him that Joker is long gone, however, he is actually around the corner. Sheila hands her own son over to the Joker, who begins to savagely beat Jason to a pulp with a crowbar . Double-crossing Jason's mother, he leaves them both to die. When Todd awoke, he and his unconscious mother were next to a bomb in a warehouse. His last action was to try to shield his mother from the blast. Batman came in time to see the warehouse explode. He tore through the rubble and found Jason's dead body.<\/p><h4>The Lost Days<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204875\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/204875-96885-jason-todd.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.07\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/204875-96885-jason-todd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-204875\"><img alt=\"Jason Todd lives again\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" data-width=\"598\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/204875-96885-jason-todd.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/204875-96885-jason-todd.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jason Todd lives again\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/204875-96885-jason-todd.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/204875-96885-jason-todd.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" data-width=\"598\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Jason Todd lives again<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Due to the reality warping effects of <a href=\"\/superman-prime\/4005-40756\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\">Superboy-Prime<\/a> punching his way into the main reality, Jason Todd's corpse was revived in his grave. Still badly injured from what the Joker did to him, he was able to dig his way to the surface and walk over twelve miles before collapsing and being found by a lost couple driving down the road. He was brought to the hospital and treated as a John Doe after slipping into a coma, as he could not provide anyone with answers. He would eventually awaken and escape through the window. However, he had suffered brain damage and remained partially catatonic as he lived on the streets. Instincts and muscle memory were what he survived on. Fighting a homeless man who had attacked him, his moves were witnessed and recognized by a former hired thug he had fought as Robin. The thug called in some old contacts to turn him in for a reward. Word made its way to <a href=\"\/talia\/4005-4917\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4917\">Talia al Ghul<\/a>, and she paid to have Jason abducted and brought to her.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/ras-al-ghul\/4005-40816\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40816\">Ra's al Ghul<\/a> was intrigued but unconvinced of his daughter's opinion that Jason was worth anything to them, due to the severe brain damage he had suffered. He decided that Jason would be sent away but remain protected and cared for out of respect for Bruce Wayne. As far as Ra's was concerned, to do anything more with Jason outweighed the potential risk if Batman were to find out. However, Talia disobeyed her father. She took Jason to the <a href=\"\/lazarus-pit\/4055-40817\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40817\">Lazarus Pit<\/a> her father was using and shoved him in. The shock and healing properties of the pit healed Jason's mind. He was confused and panicked, but Talia rushed him away before her father could retaliate. She had little time to explain anything to him, so all she said was for him not to go to <a href=\"\/batman\/4005-1699\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman<\/a> and find out the truth instead. He had not been avenged.<\/p><p>Jason did as <a href=\"\/talia\/4005-4917\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4917\">Talia<\/a> told him to do and quickly discovered the truth in her words. After his murder, Batman had done nothing more than send the <a href=\"\/joker\/4005-1702\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker<\/a> back to jail like his death was just another one of the Joker's crazy schemes. This was too much for Jason to handle so soon. He was only days out of his traumatic revival in the <a href=\"\/lazarus-pit\/4055-40817\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40817\">Lazarus Pit<\/a>, and he was now overwhelmed with grief and rage about what he had learned. In his anguish, he believed <a href=\"\/batman\/4005-1699\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman<\/a> only thought of him as an expendable soldier and that his death clearly meant nothing to the dark knight. Riding on the wave of his anger, he headed straight for <a href=\"\/gotham-city\/4020-23611\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23611\">Gotham City<\/a> on a mission of revenge.<\/p><p>Jason did not arrive in Gotham City to hunt down the Joker. Instead, his desire for vengeance took him straight to Batman. He used all of his training as <a href=\"\/robin\/4005-1687\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\">Robin<\/a> to keep surveillance on Batman and orchestrate a setup. He knew all the right places to feed information so that Batman would hear about it, and he fabricated a story about a major gun buy going down in the city. He was waiting when Batman arrived, knowing that Batman would park the <a href=\"\/batmobile\/4055-41463\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\">Batmobile<\/a> a certain distance away from the intended destination. He also knew all the Batmobile's security features, allowing him to rig it with an explosive while Batman was gone. This could have been the death of Batman, but when the time came Jason did not pull the trigger. He later explained to <a href=\"\/talia\/4005-4917\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4917\">Talia<\/a> that it was because he wanted Batman to know it was him in the end. He wanted to actually face Batman, and he wanted her help to do it.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329633\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/1329633-jt01.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.04\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:104.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/1329633-jt01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1329633\"><img alt=\"A curse unleashed upon the world\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" data-width=\"615\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/1329633-jt01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/1329633-jt01.jpg 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A curse unleashed upon the world\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/1329633-jt01.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/1329633-jt01.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" data-width=\"615\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A curse unleashed upon the world<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Jason did not realize that Talia was shocked at his actions and the path he had set himself upon. He also did not realize she was helping him partly to delay him from actually doing anything. But it also did not matter, because he was getting what he wanted. He set about on a quest to further the training <a href=\"\/batman\/4005-1699\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman<\/a> had given him and learn what Batman would not teach him. He underwent intensive training in firearms from an expert sniper. He spent weeks learning from a chemist about toxins and other things. Then, he went to train under a German assassin called Egon and his quest took an unexpected turn.<\/p><p>Egon was a highly skilled fighter, as was Jason. But Jason's fighting ability came from <a href=\"\/batman\/4005-1699\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman.<\/a> He was taught only how to defend and disable, and now, he needed to learn how to maim and kill. He spent weeks training in brutality before his suspicions got the better of him. Something about Egon's operation bothered him. Egon's men were thugs and not expert killers. This and other things led Jason to believe Egon's business was more than contract killings. He was right and found Egon's child slavery operation. Immediately, he commandeered the truck transporting the children and brought them to safety. He then returned for Egon and killed the slaver.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1372383\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/58664\/1372383-1372216_red_hood___the_lost_days__4_003_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.428927680798\" data-width=\"401\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 401px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/58664\/1372383-1372216_red_hood___the_lost_days__4_003_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1372383\"><img alt=\"Following a New Path\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-width=\"447\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/58664\/1372383-1372216_red_hood___the_lost_days__4_003_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/58664\/1372383-1372216_red_hood___the_lost_days__4_003_super.jpg 401w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Following a New Path\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/58664\/1372383-1372216_red_hood___the_lost_days__4_003_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/58664\/1372383-1372216_red_hood___the_lost_days__4_003_super.jpg 401w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-width=\"447\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Following a New Path<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Jason had just taken the first steps on a new path. In the many months that followed, half of the dangerous men and women he studied under wound up dead by either his hands or his schemes. These were not arbitrary killings. In his mind, these people deserved it. The surveillance expert he learned from turned out to be a pedophile. The close combat master intended to murder her own family. The team of mercenaries he joined and left to die in an ambush were responsible for terrible atrocities in Africa. He was willing to learn from and work with some bad people to achieve his goals, but there was only so much he was willing to overlook.<\/p><p>The inevitable soon came to pass. Talia al Ghul showed him some surveillance photos from Gotham City and informed Jason that there was now a new Robin named <a href=\"\/tim-drake\/4005-9290\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Tim Drake<\/a>. As much as he tried to pretend it did not bother him, it did. This news came in the middle of him uncovering a plot by the Russian mob to detonate explosives throughout London in a staged terrorist attack. This was not a situation he could fix by killing his teacher, as he had previously done. This was a much larger threat than he had dealt with before. In trying to sabotage the explosives to prevent the attack, he ended up making a series of stupid mistakes he normally would not have. He was caught and left to the mercy of the Russians orchestrating the attack.<\/p><p>Some quick thinking allowed Jason to narrowly escape with his life, and he went straight after his bomb-making teacher. Since his plan to sabotage the bombs was a bust, he needed to know where all the bombs were going, and he made sure the bomb-maker gave him some honest answers. With a list of names, he scrambled throughout London to relieve each of the unaware suicide bombers of their packages. He caught up to the final bomb just in time to throw it off of Westminster Bridge.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1495393\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.54296875\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1495393\"><img alt=\"Can't kill the Joker\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg 622w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg 414w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Can't kill the Joker\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg 622w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1495393-red_hood___the_lost_days__6_014.jpg 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Can't kill the Joker<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Back at his safehouse, the Russians were waiting for him. He took the kill squad head on, using the skills he had learned thus far to be the last man standing. None of them really deserved to leave the room breathing as far as he was concerned. The sole survivor tried to bargain for his life with everything from cash to every scrap of valuable information in his head. Jason was not particularly interested in any of it until the man blurted out that he knew the whereabouts of the Joker. Jason quickly found out where Joker was at, and went to track him down. Joker had a plan to poison the drinking water in Gotham City so that all the people of Gotham, will burn with a smile. The poison was actually a liquid that could travel in water and would instantly ignite when it reaches the air. This would destroy millions of lives and would leave Gotham crippled, for villains to steal. While having a tracer attached to a snag, he found out where Joker was going to get a big shipment of this fuel.<\/p><p>Wanting revenge, Jason decided that he was going to kill Joker for the pain and suffering that he's had and also others have had. Jason was lead to a shipping warehouse which led him to a confrontation with Joker's henchman. Knowing that he hadn't a whole bunch of time, Jason threw a smoke grenade which made Joker's henchman fuzzy and slower. The henchman quickly shot Jason's back, however the body armor that Jason was using saved him from the death. Jason wanted to kill Joker in public, but knew that he had to do it quickly. Jason placed Joker in a little small warehouse where he started to pour gasoline on the Joker. Remembering what the Joker did to him, Jason couldn't ignite the fire. He soon left when he heard the henchmen opening the door.<\/p><p>Back at Talia's house, Jason told Talia that he couldn't kill Joker because he needed Batman to be there as well. He wanted to kill both Batman and Joker to make them suffer for what they did.<\/p><h4>Hush<\/h4><p><b>For further details:<\/b> <a href=\"\/hush\/4045-40875\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40875\">Hush<\/a><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-543906\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/543906-06.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0877192982456\" data-width=\"513\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 513px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/543906-06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-543906\"><img alt=\"Jason confronts his mentor\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" data-width=\"588\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/543906-06.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/543906-06.jpg 513w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jason confronts his mentor\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/543906-06.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/543906-06.jpg 513w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" data-width=\"588\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Jason confronts his mentor<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Eventually, Talia sent him word of something being planned in Gotham against Batman.

Talia agreed to help him out with this, and they eventually spend the night with one another. The next night, Jason Todd was meeting with Thomas Elliot, whom was operating under the guise of Hush.

He did not come to fight crime in the city. He came to influence it to avenge his death. He called a meet with the top street dealers in Gotham and informed them that he would be running the drug trade from now on by showing them the severed heads of their top lieutenants he had killed. The new rules were simple. He would get forty percent of the profit, and they would not sell to kids. If they broke that last rule, he would kill them. He also made moves to get the attention of the major crime figure of the time in Gotham, the <a href=\"\/black-mask\/4005-3724\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3724\">Black Mask<\/a>. He disrupted a major weapons shipment coming in from the docks, destroying most of the weapons and activating an <a href=\"\/amazo\/4005-3737\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3737\">Amazo<\/a> android so Batman and Nightwing would take care of it. What he took from it was a crate of <a href=\"\/kryptonite\/4055-32213\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">Kryptonite<\/a> and then acted like he was willing to sell it back to the Black Mask. In return, the Black Mask sent <a href=\"\/mr-freeze\/4005-3715\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3715\">Mr. Freeze<\/a> to kill him, but he was expecting something of that nature anyway. He took out the hit-men accompanying Mr. Freeze and escaped when Batman and Nightwing showed up, saying all he wanted was the lay of the land.<\/p><p>Done with making his big debut as the Red Hood, he tracked down the whereabouts of the <a href=\"\/joker\/4005-1702\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker<\/a> to some abandoned carnival fair ground. He did not kill the Joker, but he did beat the man to near death with a crowbar. Similar to how the Joker originally killed him.<\/p><p>Jason continued his activities as the Red Hood, enforcing his new rules upon the drug trade and warring with the <a href=\"\/black-mask\/4005-3724\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3724\">Black Mask<\/a>'s criminal empire. He considered himself a killer and not a murderer. The people he killed were not innocents. Soon, he finally faced off in a battle against <a href=\"\/batman\/4005-1699\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman<\/a> that saw them both unmasked before each other, confirming who he really was to Batman.<\/p><p>Now that his identity was no longer a mystery, he broke into <a href=\"\/titans-tower\/4020-55705\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55705\">Titans Tower<\/a> to confront Tim Drake, the boy who had replaced him. He he fought with <a href=\"\/cyborg\/4005-2388\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2388\">Cyborg<\/a> and <a href=\"\/beast-boy\/4005-3586\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3586\">Beast Boy<\/a> and defeated them easily. <a href=\"\/raven\/4005-3584\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3584\">Raven<\/a> was in the tower but Jason decided to allow her to sleep because she was one of the few people that had actually cared for him during his time with the Titans. He wished her to have good dreams for once. He remembered her advices and said she was right when she told him to watch his temper and remembered the he really cared for her safety. He got rid of them so he and Tim would not be interrupted. The two Robins fought with Jason ridiculed the belief that Tim figured out who Batman really was and said that if anything, Batman meant for him to find out. He also ridiculed the idea that even <a href=\"\/kole\/4005-30520\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30520\">Kole<\/a>had a memorial statue in the Tower but not him. He may have only been a Titan for a very brief time, but he had been one. He became impressed with Tim in their fight and started to understands why Bruce chose him as the new Robin and he had to cheat to beat Tim, gassing him and leaving him unconscious to be found by the Titans later. He writes a note in blood on the wall saying \"Jason Todd Was Here.\" Afterward, he observed that Tim was a good Robin. Jason wondered if had he had friends like Tim did when he was Robin, would he have become a better person.<\/p><p>Later, he kidnapped the <a href=\"\/joker\/4005-1702\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker<\/a> and ventured to <a href=\"\/crime-alley\/4020-55715\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55715\">Crime Alley<\/a>, where they first met and where Bruce Wayne's parents died. He questioned Batman about why he didn't murder Joker to avenge him, and Batman said he refused to kill. They battled and at the same time argued, which Bruce used as a distraction to beat him. Getting the Joker from where he'd hidden him, Jason finally gave him a choice-kill Joker or he would. He counted down from three after tossing Batman a loaded gun, but Batman sliced his neck with a <a href=\"\/batarang\/4055-46297\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46297\">Batarang<\/a>. Joker detonated explosives then that exploded the platform they were on, ending the fight.<\/p><p>Jason survived the explosion and continued as the Red Hood. While doing routine surveillance on criminals in Gotham, he overheard a conversation <a href=\"\/deathstroke\/4005-3588\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3588\">Deathstroke<\/a> was having about having framed <a href=\"\/black-lightning\/4005-10994\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10994\">Black Lightning<\/a> for murder. Jason confirmed it and passed the information on to Nightwing. This led to the <a href=\"\/outsiders\/4060-5704\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5704\">Outsiders<\/a> breaking Black Lightning out of <a href=\"\/iron-heights\/4020-41410\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41410\">Iron Heights<\/a>.<\/p><h4>Nightwing?<\/h4><p>Some months later, Jason had relocated to Manhattan and taken on the Nightwing identity in Dick Grayson's absence. When Dick found out, Jason taunted him over it. To Jason, it was all a big joke, but Dick did not appreciate what Jason's fatal methods were doing to his reputation. Along with a third Nightwing, <a href=\"\/cheyenne-freemont\/4005-49105\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49105\">Cheyenne Freemont<\/a>, they had to deal with a pair of metahuman brothers. Jason was nearly killed and temporarily mutated by a creature the brothers employed in which Dick had to help cure him. He recovered and discarded the Nightwing identity.<\/p><h4>Seeing Red<\/h4><p>Jason returned to his Red Hood identity and travelled out to <a href=\"\/star-city\/4020-47878\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-47878\">Star City<\/a>. Some of the weapons shipments he was counting on went bad because of Batman's and <a href=\"\/green-arrow\/4005-5936\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5936\">Green Arrow<\/a>'s interference, so he wanted to make a point. He made an alliance with Star City crime boss <a href=\"\/brick\/4005-4452\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4452\">Brick<\/a> to keep the two heroes busy and allow him to abduct <a href=\"\/speedy\/4005-5300\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5300\">Speedy<\/a>. He put her through the paces but also talked to her. They had a lot in common. They were both street kids taken in by billionaire mentors. She knew as he did that sometimes you had to do bad things to do greater good. Green Arrow and Batman arrived after he had already blown up the gymnasium he had her in. She survived, saying she managed to escape before the blast. However, Speedy thinks that Jason might have simply let her go.<\/p><h4>Countdown to Final Crisis<\/h4><p><b>For further details:<\/b> <a href=\"\/countdown-to-final-crisis\/4045-56194\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56194\">Countdown to Final Crisis<\/a><\/p><p>In the process of rescuing a woman, Jason witnessed the sudden death of the Joker's Daughter by a Monitor and the attempted intervention of a second Monitor. Naturally, he was suspected of being Duela's murderer and tried to lie low until eventually approaching Donna Troy. He told her the truth of what happened with Duela and the two Monitors, suspecting that they both may also be targets due to their unique resurrections. Suddenly, they are attacked by an unfamiliar woman calling herself the Forerunner and saved from death by the second Monitor Jason had seen before. This Monitor, who Jason named Bob for reference's sake, warned of a coming disaster and drafted them both to help him search for Ray Palmer, who Bob believed was the key everything.<\/p><p>The group, becoming unofficially regarded as the Challengers from Beyond, proceeded on a quest through the new Multiverse and were soon joined by Kyle Rayner. Through their travels, Jason encountered several versions of the Batman he knew, including everything from a vampire Batman to one who was a Russian terrorist. They even arrived on an Earth where he had taken up the cowl and become Batman himself. As time went on, Jason became increasingly frustrated with Bob's inability to find Ray Palmer and possibly with Kyle's presence vying for Donna's attention. It did not help that the other Monitors had seemingly aligned against them behind Solomon, the Monitor who killed Duela, and that the Monarch was raising a multiversal army to battle them. Jason and the other Challengers were stuck in the middle of an increasingly chaotic situation.<\/p><p>Finally, they find Ray on a seemingly perfect Earth. Many heroes there had retired to live happy normal lives because crime due to supervillains was so minor. But upon finding Ray, Bob turned on them and revealed he only used them to help him find and kill Ray for Solomon. The situation quickly escalated as the Monarch's army arrived and war broke out on that Earth. Jason became separated from the others, getting captured and interrogated by that world's Batman. It was then that Jason discovered what made that Earth so much better than the others. After the death of his counterpart on it, Batman began using lethal force and had now taken out the majority of the serious supervillains. Batman showed him the costume the late Jason of that Earth would have worn someday, and Jason put it on, becoming Red Robin. Together, they fought the Monarch's army as best they could to protect that Earth. Unfortunately, Batman was killed in action by Ultraman. Before retreating to Apokolips, Jason crushed the skull of an alternate Joker laughing over Batman's death with a stone.<\/p><p>Apokolips proved not to be much of a safer place to be. <a href=\"\/brother-eye\/4005-51483\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51483\">Brother EYE<\/a> was somehow assimilating the planet, and other heroes and criminals had been drawn into the crisis. After defeating Brother EYE, Jason and the others were transported by Solomon to what they believed was their home Earth only to discover it was simply a close facsimile. They witnessed this Earth ravaged by a great disaster and managed to escape to return to their actual home Earth. Once there, Jason abruptly took his leave, bitterly reaffirming how he felt about superheroics and immediately ditching the Red Robin costume.<\/p><h4>Back to Gotham<\/h4><p>Jason went back to business as usual as the Red Hood, soon running afoul of Tim Drake. His time away in the multiverse had lost him ground in Gotham that he had to make up again. He was working at taking control of as many street gangs as possible and using them in a gang war to thin the herd. The next step would have been to use them to get at the corrupt cops, then leave them to take care of their own turfs. Batman was missing in action. Someone had to do something about Gotham City.<\/p><p>He half-heartedly tries to get Tim to join him in the plan but was not surprised when that did not work out. They end up fighting, and Jason gets the upper hand on Tim. Someone dressed up as <a href=\"\/general\/4005-47686\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47686\">Red Robin<\/a> interferes, knocking Jason's gun away. He was then shot in the leg by a gangbanger who picked it up. Injured, he was taken into custody by police. He was processed as John Doe and sent to <a href=\"\/blackgate-penitentiary\/4020-56051\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56051\">Blackgate<\/a>, where Tim soon came to visit him. It turned out that Tim had used a variation on Jason's idea to deal with the chaos in Gotham, and Jason tells him he did good. Tim left after giving Jason a <a href=\"\/justice-league-of-america\/4060-31815\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League<\/a> teleportation code he could use to escape.<\/p><p>Jason wasted little time before using it and getting back on Gotham's streets. However, his leg was still injured, so there was not much he could do yet. When Batman's death had been confirmed, he was invited to come to the Batcave. Bruce had left messages for everyone, even him. He listened to his message in isolation and left the Batcave without a word. Bruce had made reference to some childhood trauma Jason experienced and urged him to get help for it. Instead, Jason decided to lash out.<\/p><h4>Battle for the Cowl<\/h4><p><b>For further details:<\/b> <a href=\"\/battle-for-the-cowl\/4045-55808\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55808\">Battle for the Cowl<\/a><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-764813\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/764813-jasontodd3.png\" data-ratio=\"1.538\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/764813-jasontodd3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-764813\"><img alt=\"Jason as Batman\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/35127\/764813-jasontodd3.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/764813-jasontodd3.png 500w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/35127\/764813-jasontodd3.png 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jason as Batman\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/35127\/764813-jasontodd3.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/764813-jasontodd3.png 500w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/35127\/764813-jasontodd3.png 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Jason as Batman<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Now pushed over the edge by Bruce's final message, Jason did not simply watch as Gotham City went to hell and Dick Grayson did everything but take up Batman's cowl. He decided to take up the cowl himself and become the new Batman, but he would not follow in the tradition of Bruce Wayne. He became his own darker and harsher ideal of who Batman should be. Constructing a cave for himself in subway tunnels that had been collapsed in the Gotham quake and designing a more armored Batman costume, Jason took to the streets. He proved more than willing to use guns and lethal force, and wherever he went, he left messages declaring \"I Am Batman\" so Gotham would know that the Batman had returned.<\/p><p>This new Batman did not go unnoticed. He had a confrontation with Catwoman, during which he warned her that he would not be as lenient with her as the previous Batman had been and threatened her life. Later, he rescued Nightwing and <a href=\"\/damian-wayne\/4005-42413\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42413\">Damian Wayne<\/a> from an ambush by the Black Mask's thugs. The lethal force he used in doing so was not appreciated by Dick, and the two former Robins clashed. When <a href=\"\/black-canary\/4005-1689\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1689\">Black Canary<\/a> and <a href=\"\/huntress\/4005-1690\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1690\">Huntress<\/a> arrived to back Dick up, Jason shot Damian to cover his escape.<\/p><p>Arriving back to his Batcave, he saw that Tim Drake had deduced who he was as well as the location of his cave. Tim was also dressed in one of Batman's older costumes, so he had clearly come to challenge Jason's right to the cowl. Jason struck first in an ambush, knocking out Catwoman to keep her out of the fight. Then he and Tim threw down against each other. Jason had the upper hand in the fight until Tim stumbled upon a crowbar in the cave. Stressed and enraged, Tim began savagely striking Jason with the crowbar, only stopping when he realized Jason had stabbed a Batarang into his midsection. The fight ended there with Tim collapsing. He slowed his breathing and pulse rate to make himself appear dead, so Jason dragged his body to elsewhere in the subway tunnels.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-809849\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/809849-jasontodd18.png\" data-ratio=\"0.80363636363636\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/809849-jasontodd18.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-809849\"><img alt=\"Battle for the Cowl\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/35127\/809849-jasontodd18.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/809849-jasontodd18.png 550w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/35127\/809849-jasontodd18.png 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/35127\/809849-jasontodd18.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Battle for the Cowl\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/35127\/809849-jasontodd18.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/35127\/809849-jasontodd18.png 550w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/35127\/809849-jasontodd18.png 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/35127\/809849-jasontodd18.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Battle for the Cowl<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>With Tim out of the way, Jason then declared that there was now only one left., referring to Dick who still had not yet donned Batman's cowl himself. Knowing that Dick would be coming for him next, Jason left a taser trap waiting in the cave. It was only meant as a prelude to their fight, leaving Dick open for Jason to strike first. During the fight, Dick demanded to know where Tim was and Jason taunted him with the idea that Tim was now dead. Despite Jason's insistence, Dick did not believe it. Dick did not believe Jason was too far gone yet , and said that he knew what Bruce's message said. This only outraged Jason further, and he detonated bombs all over his Batcave to try to end their fight. Dick did not relent, and the fight moved onto a speeding train. After Dick landed a kick with more force than either expected, Jason was left dangling over the Gotham River. He refused to accept Dick's offer of help and instead chose to let go, falling a great height into the water. Despite what it appeared, Jason survived his fall.<\/p><h4>Revenge of the Red Hood<\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1012104\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.65390625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1012104\"><img alt=\"Red Hood's new look\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Hood's new look\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/3\/31666\/1012104-red_hood_12.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Red Hood's new look<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Jason survived his fall and gave up his claim to Batman's mantle. Dick was the Batman now, and Jason set out to become Dick's direct competition. He reworked his Red Hood identity to be more dramatic and attention-grabbing by creating a costume for it. Also, he stopped dying his hair black and allowed it to grow red again with a small gray streak left by his previous exposure to a Lazarus Pit. To complete his transformation, he even found himself a sidekick. This was <a href=\"\/scarlet\/4005-65427\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65427\">Scarlet<\/a>, the daughter of a criminal and the victim of Professor Pyg's practice of mutilation. His intent was for them to become Gotham City's new dynamic duo, supplanting the old one.<\/p><p>With his new partner, Jason resumed his brutal and lethal methods of dealing with criminals, but now there was a twist. Using the media and internet, he exposed his methods to the public and actively marketed them as the way things should be done. Public opinion was actually at least somewhat in his favor, especially after he showed Batman and Robin protecting the Penguin from himself and Scarlet. He was able to keep ahead of Batman and Robin, getting to criminals first and evading their attempts to apprehend him.<\/p><p>That lasted until he tracked down a criminal who got away from him to finish what he had started. Batman and Robin arrived to stop them, and the two duos fought. The fight went in Jason's favor. Instead of the two heroes capturing him, he captured them and locked them out of his way for the time being. It was then that Jason and Scarlet were ambushed by the assassin Flamingo. He took two shots from a sniper's rifle, shattering his helmet. There was something simply inhuman about the way Flamingo fought, so much so that he even resisted going down when Batman and Robin joined in. Jason took more shots as he fought Flamingo, including one to the leg. But it was him who took Flamingo down. While the assassin was distracted with Scarlet, Jason came upon him and scooped him up in the large shovel of a backhoe. He then dumped Flamingo over the edge of a steep drop, intent on killing the man. However, there was later no sign of Flamingo's body in the rubble.<\/p><p>Commissioner Gordon and the G.C.P.D. quickly appeared in the aftermath, and Jason was taken into custody. Once again, he was taken by police after being shot in the leg. But he did not go quietly. He told Dick that it was too late to do anything for him. He also accused Dick of not trying hard enough, because if he could be brought back, then so could Bruce. As far as Jason was concerned, Dick was holding back because this was the only way he could ever be out of Bruce's shadow.<\/p><h4>Streets Run Red<\/h4><p>Passing all of his psych evaluations, Jason Todd, imprisoned under a false identity, gets himself transferred out of Arkham Asylum and to the general population of Gotham City Corrections despite Batman's objections. Now free among the criminals, it did not take Jason long to get back to business. He began killing high profile criminals in the facility, making their deaths appear either as suicides or as murders committed by other inmates. No one realized what he was up to until it was too later and he had released a poison that killed 82 other inmates. Once the warden realized Jason's actions, he had Jason immediately transferred back to Arkham without waiting for Batman's help.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1894172\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/84359\/1894172-scarlet_and_red_hood.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.1087314662273\" data-width=\"607\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 607px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:110.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/84359\/1894172-scarlet_and_red_hood.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1894172\"><img alt=\"Together Again\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" data-width=\"577\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/84359\/1894172-scarlet_and_red_hood.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/84359\/1894172-scarlet_and_red_hood.jpg 607w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/84359\/1894172-scarlet_and_red_hood.jpg 577w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Together Again\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/84359\/1894172-scarlet_and_red_hood.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/84359\/1894172-scarlet_and_red_hood.jpg 607w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/84359\/1894172-scarlet_and_red_hood.jpg 577w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" data-width=\"577\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Together Again<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Jason's transport was intercepted by the Menagerie, a team of mercenaries with animal mutations. They came to free him from custody and bring him to their employer. Since this was not part of Jason's plans, he did not cooperate. Dick Grayson and Damian Wayne's intervention helped him overcome the Menagerie, but they had a message for him. Their employer had his former partner, <a href=\"\/scarlet\/4005-65427\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65427\">Scarlet<\/a>, hostage to ensure his cooperation.<\/p><p>Jason, Dick and Damian had to cooperate with one another to save Scarlet's life, starting with them taking Jason to one of his hidden caches so he could gear up in a variation of his Red Hood identity. This cooperation ended as soon as Red Hood and Scarlet were reunited.

It is revealed that Jason stopped an attempted smuggling of a nuclear submarine into Miami and it exploded but he escaped and was injured. Starfire fished him out and nursed him back to health where they quickly became friends after realizing they have a lot in common after talking about their pasts. Jason came to Roy's aid, along with <a href=\"\/starfire\/4005-2389\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2389\">Starfire<\/a>, to break Roy out of a prison in <a href=\"\/qurac\/4020-55796\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55796\">Qurac<\/a>. After the successful jailbreak, he was contacted by <a href=\"\/essence\/4005-80127\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80127\">Essence<\/a> of the All Caste, one of the groups he had learned from during his lost years. The All Caste, which he had turned his back on to pursue his own path, had been brutally eliminated. Jason immediately ditched Roy and Starfire to look into this on his own. Roy joins Jason on a flight to the Himalayas while Starfire flew ahead and secured a limo. Jason leaves them once again to gear up where he shoots down Suzie Su and her partner who try to sneak attack him. Jason now fully geared with Roy and Starfire and he travels a bit ahead of them where he finds the villagers massacred and he pays his respects to Ducra. The villagers reanimate and attack Jason, he turns and throws away his guns to fight them honorably but Roy and Starfire catch up and they start killing the zombies. Jason fights along side them defeating the horde and with the villagers defeated, Jason sits and prays for them.<\/p><p>Jason and the team meet S'aru, the protector. They all give up their most cherished memories as a collateral to get into the Chamber of All to find the object the Untitled wanted. The group ventures through the chamber and they get attacked by a giant monster. Jason and Roy do their best to defend themselves while Starfire gets eaten. Jason finds the object in the midst of the fight and retrieves it. The object turns out to be a snow globe of Colorado, meanwhile Starfire blasts the creature from the inside, killing it and then she grabs Jason and Roy and flies out of the chamber. Jason questions S'aru what the significance of the object is or why the Untitled left it behind but receives no helpful answer. They collect their memories all except for Jason who tells S'aru to keep it. The memory turns out to be a night as Robin when he had the flu and Bruce stayed home to be with the ill Jason.<\/p><p>The Outlaws make their way to Middleton Colorado due to the clue they found in the Chamber of All to find the Untitled. Jason gets into a quick scrap in the bar and a cop comes to take he and Roy to the station. Jason manages to restrain the cop while he looks for some records that could help him find the Untitled. The cop turns out to be one of the Untitled but not the one he's looking for. The cop is about to rip out Jason's liver when Roy saves him. Jason and Roy head outside where they see a huge explosion that matches Starfire's energy signature. Roy leaves Jason to go save Stafire while Jason stays to battle the Untitled.<\/p><p>Jason continues his battle with the Untitled where he ends up falling into the frozen water beneath. Jason recalls a flashback to his training with the Untitled and remembers what Ducra told him about being special and that he is just beginning a new journey. Jason leaps from the ice hole vowing that his trifles with Batman and his goal about killing Joker don't matter anymore. He cuts himself to get blood on the Blades of All to feed them. Jason manages to kill the Untitled setting a new goal that he will kill all of them one by one. It is revealed the Untitled used her powers to keep the people away but upon her death returns to her normal appearance as a mob appears. They think Jason just outright murdered the sheriff so he runs off and gets Kori and Roy telling them they need to leave.<\/p><p>Jason drops Crux off at Arkham Asylum. The team steals one of Crux's ships when Essence appears. Jason stabs her with the All blade and claims she is the one responsible for killing the All Caste. She reveals Ducra is her mother and was linked to the Untitled so she is on her own mission trying to kill all of the Untitled herself. A fight ensues when Jason grabs a molecular dispersal gun or teleportation gun causing Essence to disappear. Jason decides to try and contact the stewardess he met earlier, but decides she is better off not having him in her life.<\/p><p>The Outlaws head to Gotham where an enraged <a href=\"\/suzie-su\/4005-80576\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80576\">Suzie Su<\/a> has awakened from a coma after getting shot by Jason. It was revealed that Jason took money from the seven crime families of Hong Kong to supply his resources. Jason killed an entire clan and this allowed new clans to rise up and take its place and eventually one of those familes was the Familia De Flores and Su. Jason had everything he needed so he killed Suzie's entire gang except her and her father as a way to pay retribution for the trouble he caused.While Roy and Starfire rescued the hostages, Jason fought Suzie and ended up killing her by putting a bullet through her skull. When leaving, they intercept a message from Alfred claiming they need all Batman related allies to help since the <a href=\"\/court-of-owls\/4060-58693\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58693\">Court of the Owls<\/a> have multiple <a href=\"\/the-talons\/4060-59016\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59016\">Talons<\/a> set up around the city ready to kill forty people who have shaped Gotham. Jason gets a request from Tim Drake to stay and help. It was also revealed that about a month or two ago, Jason got intel for Tim and apologized to Tim and Tim forgave him for his past actions. They decide to stay and cover a person of interest, <a href=\"\/mr-freeze\/4005-3715\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3715\">Mr. Freeze.<\/a><\/p><p>Jason and the Outlaws are looking over a frozen covered part of Gotham going over the mission. Jason leaps down reminiscing about Gotham and arrives to help Mr. Freeze where he gets caught in the midst of a battle between a Talon and Freeze. He halts Freeze but gets his hand frozen as the Talon runs away. Jason chases the Talon down and has a brief fight with it before it runs again. Eventually he catches up to the Talon who has a heart-to-heart conversation with Jason and begs him to kill him in which Jason does. Jason ends up meeting Batgirl and throws Mr. Freeze on the rooftop for her and tells her that if she sees Batman tell him \"you're welcome.\" as they leave Gotham.<\/p><p>Jason spent the whole night on a date talking with <a href=\"\/isabel\/4005-83156\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83156\">Isabel<\/a>, the stewardess from the plane. He gets attacked by an alien, so to protect Isabel, he dons his helmet and begins to fight it. Eventually, Starfire comes out from her hotel room and the alien is introduced as <a href=\"\/orn\/4005-84345\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84345\">Orn<\/a>, one of Starfire's old friends from Tamaran. Orn tells Starfire a black shadow has fallen upon her old planet. He teleports the Outlaws and Isabel, to Starfire's ship as Roy, Jason and Isabel watch Kori take charge of the ship and prepare to attack the aliens. Jason made sure Isabel was safe when they started the fight. With the alien squadron defeated, Starfire wishes to talk with Roy and Jason. She explains her origin to them and asks because of being traded with no one helping her, should she fight for Tamaran? Jason tells her she has every right to be mad and not help. He even compares it to his former Batman and Joker situation but shows support when Roy tells her she should and he apologizes to Isabel about the whole matter. Jason is seen happy with Isabel, but the Blight attack. So the team defends the ship. After Roy teleports back with a now freed <a href=\"\/blackfire\/4005-12502\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12502\">Blackfire<\/a>, Jason, Roy and the rest of the crew watch as Starfire and Blackfire leave to go save Tamaran.<\/p><p>Jason helps Starfire and Blackfire fight the Blight off on Tamaran. He gets caught by a Blight but is saved by Orn. After the battle, Isabel mentions she wishes she could fill out uniforms like Starfire but Jason remarks she does just fine. Jason and the Outlaws leave Tamaran in a new ship named after <a href=\"\/depalo\/4005-84346\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84346\">Depalo<\/a> after his brave sacrifice of taking the Starfire ship into the Blight mothership and self-destructing it from the inside out, and head back to Earth, but unbeknownst to them, the Joker sneaks into a hideout and grabs one of the Red Hood masks.<\/p><p>The Outlaws head back towards but are encountered by <a href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman<\/a>. Jason tells the Outlaws he is one of the only beings he fears. They teleport back to Earth but Superman is already there waiting. The Outlaws begin an assault on Superman but fail miserably as the Kryptonian is just too powerful. He incapacitates them easily and they finally decide to talk as Superman originally requested. He asks Starfire about any <a href=\"\/daemonites\/4060-41061\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41061\">Daemonites<\/a> which she lies and tells him no. Superman tells them to contact him if anything comes up. The Outlaws drop Jason and Isabel off at her apartment where they get intimate and while Jason goes and takes a shower he comes back in realizes Isabel has been assaulted as she lies on the floor with needles everywhere. The Joker appears on the TV under the guise of a weather man and tells Jason that she is still alive and he has called the EMT's but also the authorities as the authorities head into the room.<\/p><p>Jason fights off the authorities and gets a key to a vehicle where he is attacked by the Joker and taken to an unknown location where through the Joker's prep, Jason is defeated and falls into a room with an unconscious Tim Drake.<\/p><p>After the events of Death of The Family, Jason goes back to Wayne Manor to say goodbye. After talking to: Nightwing, Robin, Alfred and Batman, Jason puts on his helmet and it tightens. The helmet reveals a hologram of The Joker who modified the helmet to do so. The Joker talks about how Jason \"played a joke\" on him and that he wasn't laughing. The mask starts to give out gas and Jason starts laughing maniacally. Batman and the others rush to help, but it's too late, and Jason falls to the ground with a burnt face. The one that heard the Joker voice was Batman and Robin-Damian. Alfred, Arsenal, Starfire and Batman hold on to him and were shocked to see what happened to Jason Todd just before he left the Wayne Manor with his team.<\/p><p>The Joker planted an acid bomb in the mask, leaving Jason in critical condition. Jason is met by Ducra in a dream world where he must make the choice of living in the past or letting go and going for the future. Jason finally admits he loves his friends and lets go of the past where he finally wakes up and attempts to apologize to Bruce, but Bruce cuts him off and hugs him instead. Bruce brings Jason on a mission where they stop some mercenaries in Ethiopia. It was revealed to be a ruse by Bruce to bring Jason to where he died to try and reawaken a memory so Bruce could bring Damian back to life. Jason and Bruce fight, but Jason eventually stops and takes the car, leaving Bruce to remain by himself.<\/p><p>Roy and Kori make it into the Acres of All in search of Jason. They fight off some creatures, but when a big one shows up, Jason saves them and he has no memory of them. It is revealed that Jason flied to the All-Caste hideaway to find S'aru and have him remove his memories that the darkness has gotten the better of him in his life and S'aru just takes them all. His recent fight with Bruce drove him to do this.<\/p><p>Jason watches as Roy and Kori are taken through Jason's memories by S'aru to understand what he went through and a new revelation came about where Jason saved Roy the day before he left to track his mother. Jason wishes for Roy to just start over but Roy tranqs him and the group is teleported away by S'aru back into mountains with Ducra, Essence, and S'aru watching over them.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3216690\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111113435\/3216690-screen+shot+2013-08-03+at+12.53.38.png\" data-ratio=\"0.70974155069583\" data-width=\"503\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 503px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111113435\/3216690-screen+shot+2013-08-03+at+12.53.38.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3216690\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111113435\/3216690-screen+shot+2013-08-03+at+12.53.38.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111113435\/3216690-screen+shot+2013-08-03+at+12.53.38.png 503w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11111\/111113435\/3216690-screen+shot+2013-08-03+at+12.53.38.png 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111113435\/3216690-screen+shot+2013-08-03+at+12.53.38.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111113435\/3216690-screen+shot+2013-08-03+at+12.53.38.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11111\/111113435\/3216690-screen+shot+2013-08-03+at+12.53.38.png 503w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11111\/111113435\/3216690-screen+shot+2013-08-03+at+12.53.38.png 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11111\/111113435\/3216690-screen+shot+2013-08-03+at+12.53.38.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>The group returns to their island base and Jason accesses the files of himself and finds what he has done in the past as a killer.

Cheshire manages to escape, but in the midst of everything Jason ends up secretly leaving as well, stowing himself away on Green Arrow's ship. Jason is soon chased by the League of Assassins and he ends up getting captured and to his surprise is treated kindly. They do end up telling him it is his destiny to lead the League of Assassins against the Untitled; the same group responsible for destroying his prior mentors the All-Caste. Jason is skeptical due to his amnesia, but the League assures him he won't have to worry as the defences around the sacred city are impenetrable, as the technology needed to breach it isn't readily available on Earth. Unbeknownst to them, the Untitled have deceived Roy 'Arsenal' Harper into helping them, playing on Arsenal's loyalty to his friends and his desire to protect the amnesiac Jason. Using his prodigious engineering skills, he designs a weapon to help breach the sacred city and 'rescue' his friend.<\/p><h3>Red Hood and the Outlaws: Rebirth<\/h3><p>As of <a title=\"DC Rebirth\" href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/dc-rebirth\/4015-56950\/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56950\">DC Rebirth<\/a>, Jason Todd's backstory reverts to his original meeting with Batman occurring while trying to steal tires from the Batmobile. Instead of fleeing at the sight of him, Jason attacks him with his tire iron. Impressed, Batman takes him out for food, then later takes him in and raises him as the new Robin. On a mission to capture <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/two-face\/4005-5555\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5555\">Two-Face<\/a>, he realizes that Jason has a violent streak. Later, he is captured, tortured, and killed by the Joker. After being revived by the Lazarus Pit, he returns to Gotham, but the problems between them put a strain on their relationship.<\/p><p>In the present, Jason is flying over a group of policemen on a motorcycle. Landing right in front of the Mayor as he is giving a speech. Though the mayor tries to bargain, Jason dismissively aims his gun at him. Before he can shoot, a <a href=\"\/batarang\/4055-46297\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-46297\">Batarang<\/a> lodges itself on his armor. Jason realizes what's coming right before the Batarang explodes, knocking him flat on his back. As Batman towers over him, Jason recognizes that after all these years, the sight of his mentor still intimidates him. He considers fleeing for a moment, then decides to shoot Batman's feet, Bruce easily dodges while Jason asks for asks him to let him explain later. He refuses, so Jason initiates a close-quarters brawl. He gets a shot in, but Batman easily gets the upper hand and puts Jason in bear-hug. Knowing he was outmatched, Jason took precautions, one which was a taser built into the Bat-symbol on his armor, which he uses to send Batman flying. With Batman out of the way, he decks the Mayor then, despite Batman's plea, shoots him.<\/p><p>Later, Jason is at a bar frequented by criminals, watching the news coverage of his assassination attempt. <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/penguin\/4005-4885\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4885\">Penguin<\/a> congratulates him on making his mark in the Gotham underworld. The bartend hands Jason a drink and warns him about the history and danger of the name Red Hood, and advises to be cautious, lest his <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/joker\/4005-1702\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">namesake<\/a> come for him. He is then approached by a member of <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/black-mask\/4005-3724\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3724\">Black Mask's<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/false-face-society\/4060-55865\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55865\">gang<\/a>. He leaves a card with Jason and an offer to join his operation.<\/p><p>Jason returns to his base underneath One Police Plaza to find that Batman has found him. He compliments his choice of location then reveals the truth about the attack on the mayor: Jason shot him with an antidote to a techno-organic virus inside of him and the cops in his way with sedatives. Bruce wants to know why he didn't tell him the truth, and he responds with a question; why Bruce didn't trust him. Bruce he does trust him, which is why he asked him to investigate connection between the city hall and a new international crime cartel, which is how Jason found out about the virus in the mayor. Jason wants to even deeper undercover, but Bruce won't allow it. He claims he won't support him because he's not <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/dick-grayson\/4005-1691\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1691\">Dick<\/a>, but it's actually because of his history of crossing the line. Jason reminds him of what he said to Jason when they first met about giving people a chance, and asks for a chance to show why Red Hood is so valuable. Bruce relents, but with the stipulation that he will pull Jason out if he goes too far. As he leaves, warns that if Jason kills one person for any reason, he will come for him.<\/p><p>Jason reminisces about his early days as Robin. As he comments on Batman's trophy gallery, Alfred arrives to take a photo. While Jason tries to pose, Batman remains as serious as ever. Before heading out Jason ponders his choices and who he's become while looking at that same photo, where Bruce is seen actually smiling. Though he's not the person Bruce wanted him to be, he believes that he'll come to understand that he is who Batman needs.<\/p><h3>Dark Trinity<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5739228-rh+reborn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5739228\" data-ratio=\"1.0902896081772\" data-width=\"587\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 587px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:109.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static1.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5739228-rh+reborn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5739228\"><img alt=\"Red Hood: Rebirth\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" data-width=\"587\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5739228-rh+reborn.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5739228-rh+reborn.jpg 587w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Hood: Rebirth\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5739228-rh+reborn.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5739228-rh+reborn.jpg 587w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" data-width=\"587\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Red Hood: Rebirth<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In the past, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/ma-gunn\/4005-30350\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30350\">Ma Gunn<\/a> is shoots Batman for interfering with her plan, while Jason is hiding behind a desk. While she complains about the injuries Batman inflicted on her charges, while Batman condemns her using those charges as weapons. Meanwhile, Jason is thinking about how Bruce sent him there to help straighten him out. However, they discoverd they were teaching the boys there to become career criminals. As she is about to kill Batman, Jason breaks cover. Even though Batman could have taken her himself, Jason decides to spice things up himself. Shocking everyone, he charges Ma Gunn and tackles her out of a window.<\/p><p>In the present, Red Hood jumps out of Gunn's old school, carrying her in his arms as the building explodes. Even though Hood is fine, Gunn was not breathing. When he manages to revive her, she recognizes him as Jason. When the two are settled and Red Hood convinces her that he is not Jason Todd, asks if she knows who was responsible for the bombing. Unaware that he already knew about her past, she recaps. Starting from her ambitions to use children to help build her criminal empire to her run-in with Batman. Having recently been released from prison, she intended to start over until she was invited to dinner by an old affiliate; Roman Sionis a.k.a. Black Mask. He wanted her to surrender her operation as part of his plan to consolidate the criminals in Gotham under his banner. She refused, which led to the bombing. Ironically, she was unable to reopen her school on time, which prevented any youths from being caught in the bombing. Even though the thought of young boys dying made Jason want to kill Roman, he adheres to his promise to Bruce.<\/p><p>Returning to his base, he spends several days gathering intel on Black Mask. While he searches, he remembers a mission from his Robin days where he and Bruce were tracking <a href=\"\/riddler\/4005-3718\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3718\">Riddler<\/a>. Jason wanted to charge in and take him, until Bruce reveals the escape route in the building he's hiding in, after which Bruce reminds him about being prepared. Remembering similar words of advice about knowing you enemy, Jason looks over everything he has on Roman, from his birth to his current expansion of his operations and elimination of competition. Having what he needs to know, he resolves to rest, and talk to Roman the next day.<\/p><p>However, by talking, he meant breaking into his car. Pinning his men down and putting a gun to Roman's chin, he states that he's there to talk about the offer given to him. Unfazed, Roman congratulates him for meeting his expectations. The two head up to a skyscraper, where he talks about his ambitions to rule Gotham how he feels is the right way, unlike other criminals in town. while Roman talks, Jason remembers Bruce's speech about not killing his enemies. Back in the present, Roman reveals that he is looking for a second-in-command, and thinks Red Hood is a fitting heir. He then takes Jason to an \"audition,\" where he is ordered to kill the men who failed to kill Ma Gunn. Jason refuses claiming they have more value alive. Even though he respects Jason's morals, he presses a button that causes all of the men's heads to explode despite their pleas for mercy.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729619-red+hood+vs+artemis.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5729619\" data-ratio=\"0.442194092827\" data-width=\"1185\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1185px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:44.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729619-red+hood+vs+artemis.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5729619\"><img alt=\"Red Hood vs. Artemis\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5729619-red+hood+vs+artemis.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729619-red+hood+vs+artemis.jpg 1185w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5729619-red+hood+vs+artemis.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5729619-red+hood+vs+artemis.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Hood vs. Artemis\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5729619-red+hood+vs+artemis.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729619-red+hood+vs+artemis.jpg 1185w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5729619-red+hood+vs+artemis.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5729619-red+hood+vs+artemis.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Red Hood vs. Artemis<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Later that night, Jason and two henchmen are sent to grab Black Mask's \"game-changer.\" As the train is private and abandoned, he feels that this will be simple. despite not knowing what this game-changing weapon is. Setting off a charge that derails the train, he instructs the henchmen to quickly get their quarry. However a voice calls out that they won't get what they're looking for. This person then tosses debris a the group, taking down the gangsters. Jason dodges and draws his pistol while the figure commands him to disarm. Jason replies by asking for a name, and she reveals herself to be <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/artemis\/4005-2359\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2359\">Artemis<\/a>, who vows to be the last woman he sees if he does not get his guns out of her face.<\/p><p>He explains he is only searching for a weapon, but Artemis is surprised that he doesn't understand that he is handing over a world destroying power.

However, she uses her axe to deflect the shots. Deciding the use of a weapon was unnecessary, she decides to use her hands instead. She then proceeds to pummel him after he calls her \"princess,\" a nickname that strikes a nerve.<\/p><p>Before she delivers a killing blow, Jason asks her about the weapon she is searching for. while she explains the nature of this weapon, Jason uses up the charge is his taser to knock her out. Suddenly, he realizes Black Mask has com personally to claim his weapon. When Jason asks about Artemis' presence, he states that what she is looking for is not the weapon he has. Her quarry is an ancient weapon, while his relies on state-of-the-art genetic science. While they talk, Artemis quickly recovers and calls Mistress back to her and renews her attack. Jason tries to explain that they are after two separate things, but more of Black Mask's lackey's lackeys shoot at her. Red Hood helps her get to cover and, while out of view, Artemis realizes Jason is hiding his true intentions. After explaining his mission, the two call a truce, which she considers a surrender. When they break cover, they find out that Black Mask has called in a helicopter to take the train car containing his prize. When the lackeys begin shooting at Artemis again, Jason tackles her into an abandoned train car for cover. Black Mask leaves Jason behind, and Artemis cannot fly, leaving the duo stuck. However, Artemis' uses her strength to catch the chopper. She tosses Jason up to to the train car before leaping up there herself. Once inside, they realize two things: Artemis' weapon isn't there. and Black Mask's weapon is a Superman clone.<\/p><p>Jason is again lost in his memories, remembering his first time going out as Robin without Batman. After the fact, he returns to the Batcave, bloodied and beaten, and stares at the display case containing the original Robin costume.<\/p><p>Artemis' voice stirs him from his daydreaming. She scolds him for his lack of focus, reminding him of how dangerous a Superman clone in Black Mask's hands can be. To their surprise, Black Mask is in the train car with them. Before anyone can react, knockout gas fills covers the room. Because Artemis damaged his mask, Jason passes out from the gas.<\/p><p>Jason wakes up in Roman's base. At first he is glad to still be on Roman's good side, but he then notices one of his helmets on the desk next to the bed. Recognizing Roman's ability to think ahead, he wonders if helmet is a copy or a spare from Jason's bunker. As he changes, he wonders if he is really fooling Black Mask. Heading upstairs to meet with the boss, Roman congratulates him besting an Amazon and apologizes for knocking him out along with her. After forgiving him, Jason inquires about Artemis, but he dodges the inquiry to show Jason where the clone is being kept. Entering a lab more advanced than anything the <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/justice-league-of-america\/4060-31815\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League<\/a> can even afford, Roman explains how he heard about clone through scientists that he hired. After hearing the clone belonged to Lex Luthor, once he confirmed its existence and found out Luthor ordered it destroyed, he instead had it delivered to Gotham. He also reveals that he wanted Jason to try to steal it in order to trip the chamber's defenses so it could be grabbed with little risk. As the scientists open the chamber, Jason remembers his rebirth in the Lazarus Pit. Roman then realizes the clone is having trouble breathing. The clone panics and breaks out of the chamber and begins to mutate. Jason sees the fear in his eyes, and comforts him as he becomes a full blown <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/bizarro\/4005-8312\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8312\">Bizarro<\/a> clone.<\/p><p>Later, Bizarro is restrained and shown videos of Superman constantly, while his eyelids are forced open to keep him watching. Seeing as it's not working, Jason wants to use words to get to Bizarro, and Roman trusts him enough to let him try. Before he goes in, Artemis, trapped the opposite cell, tries to talk him out of it, believing him to be an empty shell. Even though Jason promises to get her out as soon as possible, she states that she can break out any time she wants and is only staying put for two reasons; to observe Bizarro, and to see if Black Mask has any leads on the location of the Bow of Ra. Irritated at all the deception going on, Red Hood considers killing everyone until Bizarro shows signs of intelligence. Sneaking off to his base, Jason hacks into LexCorp to find information. remembering the <a href=\"\/forever-evil\/4045-57223\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-57223\">last time<\/a> a Superman clone appeared, he discover the previous Bizarro.<\/p><p>Jason then heads to a nearby toy store. Feeling out of his element a store clerk offers him help as he picks out a stuffed Superman doll. Later, he eats dinner alongisde Roman, who reveals he scanned Jason's eyes the previous night to gather information on Red Hood, but found nothing on Jason Todd. Jason plays it off, so Roman asks his next question; why he has a Bat-symbol on his suit. Jason replies that he does it to annoy Batman.<\/p><p>Later, he goes to present the doll to Bizarro. Artemis advises against treating a weapon of mass destruction as an infant. After learning from his investigation into LexCorp that Bizarro will only live for a few weeks combined with the fact that both he and Artemis have been written off in the past, Jason resolves to try to reach him anyway. He goes into the cell and gives him the doll. He initially thinks it is Superman, but realizes otherwise. Jason tells him that he is not the real Superman and that he should try to be himself, officially giving him the name Bizarro. Artemis claims that he is a monster incapable of understanding him, but the statement causes him to go berserk.<\/p><p>Bizarro grabs Jason and slams him against Artemis' cell door, where he sarcastically claims he has everything under control. While Artemis refuses to help, Jason correctly assumes it's so she can maintain her cover. Bizarro then slams him into the ground for acting like he's not there. However, Jason tells Bizarro to stop, and it works long enough for him to see a way to get to him. Deciding to take the risk, he tells Bizarro to talk to the Superman doll about his problems. It works, and Jason is able to calm him down and get him to see himself and Artemis as friends. He then tells Bizarro to direct his super-hearing to the entirety of Gotham, which puts him to sleep.<\/p><p>The next day, Jason eats another meal with Roman. After seeing Jason risk his life to protect Artemis and Bizarro, he considers him a kindred spirit and a true friend, and takes him to show him something. Along the way, Roman tells him about his childhood and how he murdered his parents for not putting their criminal enterprises ahead of him. They then reach their destination; the basement, where all of his curios are stored. Jason asks is his plan to take Gotham over one block at a time. He replies that his true plan is to acquire enough power to deter everyone from challenging him. Jason then inquires about the Bow of Ra, which he explains he no longer has to Jason and Artemis, who broke out of her cell and followed them. Apparently aware she was there, silently wishes her luck in her quest.<\/p><p>Roman then goes on about his dream to rid the city of psychotics, reminding Jason of how he made the same argument to Bruce, but was shut down. While he continues his speech, he reveals the reason they came; the same techno-organic virus that infected the mayor. He then mentions Jason's failed attack on the mayor. Jason, realizing he was made, asks how long he knew the truth. Roman reveals he knew all along. While he knew Jason was planning to betray him, he truly though of Jason as a friend and again invited him to join him in his crusade. Jason immediately refuses, so Romans injects his head with the tech virus, which allows him to summon and control the superweapon Jason helped him create, Bizarro, now infected with the tech virus.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729637-red+hood+vs+bizarro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5729637\" data-ratio=\"0.93631436314363\" data-width=\"738\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 738px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static2.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729637-red+hood+vs+bizarro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5729637\"><img alt=\"Red Hood vs. Bizarro\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5729637-red+hood+vs+bizarro.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729637-red+hood+vs+bizarro.jpg 738w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5729637-red+hood+vs+bizarro.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Red Hood vs. Bizarro\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5729637-red+hood+vs+bizarro.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729637-red+hood+vs+bizarro.jpg 738w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5729637-red+hood+vs+bizarro.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Red Hood vs. Bizarro<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Using rounds strong enough to take down a tank on Bizarro, they have no effect on Bizarro as he attacks. Jason barely dodges and tries to stop him by grabbing Bizarro's cape, but his clumsiness causes him to crash through the wall, sending them both out of the building. Bizarro tries to fly, but flies downward, crashing into a fountain. When Jason rises, he realizes the crash knocked Bizarro out, and focuses on Black Mask, who hasn't achieved full control of Bizarro. Realizing that killing Roman before that happens, he lines up a shot, then remembers his promise to Bruce, and hesitates. This gives Bizarro enough time to recover and resume his attack. Bizarro then tosses Jason into a tree. He tries to convince Bizarro to resist, but he prepares to finish him off anyway.<\/p><p>Before he delivers the killing blow. Artemis tosses Mistress into Bizarro's chest, confusing everyone. When Jason asks why she didn't leave town, she claims it was because she heard him losing. As Bizarro tries to remove the asks, Artemis tells Red Hood to leave while she fights, but he refuses. Their argument gives Bizarro enough time to remove Mistress from his chest, damaging it in the process. Seeing Artemis double over in pain, Jason checks on her, but she rebuffs him, mistaking his concern for sarcasm over a joke she made earlier. As Bizarro removes the broken axe shard from his chest, Jason sees that Bizarro still recognizes them and forms a plan. He tries to get Artemis to help him, but she refuses and leaps into battle. Shen she decks Bizarro, Jason notices that Black Mask is in pain as well. She doesn't, only worried about killing Bizarro, but Jason tells her that she knows that despite her attitude, she worries about who might suffer if Black Mask isn't stopped and that's why she stayed in the city. He also tells her that killing Bizarro isn't the only pressing matter. She then agrees to try not to kill him, but not very hard.<\/p><p>Satisfied, Jason leaves Artemis to fight while he goes to implement his plan. While he knows Artemis will be able to survive, he notices two things about Black Mask. One is the damage the virus is doing to his body. The second is that he refuses to let Jason out of his sight. Jason decides to put as much strain on Roman as he can. He tries to enter his bunker, but has some trouble because One Police Plaza is being evacuated. He succeeds, and remember that even though he's used to total improvisation, he still has solid resources. He then remembers getting his ace-in-the-hole, and antidote to the techno-virus and dispersal gun designed by <a href=\"\/crux\/4005-80126\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80126\">Crux<\/a>. he prepares to load the gun. However, there is only a small amount left that may not be enough for what he has planned. Black Mask then arrives before he can load the antidote. However, Hood already knew he was there thanks to the proximity alarms. The two trade shots, Mask reveals he was five steps ahead from the start. When he peeks from behind his cover, Jason kicks him in the face before he can get a shot off.<\/p><p>Preparing to execute him, Roman claims he won't end him because of his connection to Batman, and that the reason he wears the Bat-Symbol is so he can stay connected to Batman. Jason prepares a witty response, but Roman turns around at that moment and shoots him. However, Jason's armor saves him.

Before Roman can fire, Artemis and Bizarro crash through the ceiling, buying Jason a moment to take the gun. As he disarms him, Jason calls Roman out on hypocrisy for claiming to love Gotham only to send Bizarro on a rampage. Jason takes a moment to check on Artemis, who is still fending off Bizarro. He retorts that Bizarro is only meant to get rid of the deplorables. Mask then orders Bizarro to attack and he tosses Artemis into Jason, knocking them down. Jason realizes that his control over Bizarro hasn't weakened enough, and comes up with a new plan. While the two recover, Jason fills Artemis on his new plan. Artemis is skeptical that it will work until he explains; the techno-virus is damaging Roman's brain, and if they keep fighting he will eventually burn him out.<\/p><p>With the two in agreement, they renew their attack. As they fight, Jason claims that Roman was wrong to believe they were alike, and the he has as much in common with him as he does with Batman; nothing at all. As he makes a retort, Roman collapses as a result of the virus. He then begins speaking in binary code, then Kryptonian, then manages to beg for the cure in english. As the virus further ravages his mind, Jason mocks Roman for thinking he could connect his mind to Bizarro and be fine. Roman asks again for the cure, but Jason refuses. Even without all of the crimes Jason knows he commited, he has so many crimes under his belt that Jason is compelled to leave him to his fate. Even though he vowed not to kill him, Jason refuses to help him. As he slips into a coma, Jason tells him not to blame anyone but himself for his condition.<\/p><p>When Jason checks on Artemis and Bizarro, she asks him about Black Mask, and he replies that he's no longer a problem. Artemis then prepares to leave to continue her quest for the Bow of Ra. However, Jason, feeling he owes her for her help, offers to help her. She refuses, claiming her quest is too personal for her to involve them, but Bizarro claims they're already involved. Artemis decides to let them help on the condition that they disband once her quest is complete, and they all agree.<\/p><p>Several days later, Jason meets up with Batman. Having heard that Black Mask has gone off the grid, he asks Jason what happened. Jason reveals that he didn't kill him, but copied Batman's style and did nothing. He then says that he will never do things his way again. Batman is confused, and when Jason calls his way \"the law and order crap,\" Bruce laughs. He claims his way has nothing to do with law and order. Jason then asks why he gives him such a hard time. In response, Batman reminds him of what he told him the first time he suited up.<\/p><p>Flashing back to that time, Jason is seen sitting on a gargoyle alone until Batman arrives, Jason asks how he knew where to look, and he replies that he was only kid he knew who had a \"favorite gargoyle.\" Jason reveals that he is afraid that he and Alfred were wrong and that he woulds screw up. Batman replies that he is sure that he will make mistakes and fail, but he doesn't want a perfect Robin, but someone who will do their best and make him a better person at the same time. He asks Jason if he is that person, and replies that he's Robin and Batman says it's an honor to have him.<\/p><p>In he present, Jason asks if he's okay with him not being like him, and replies that there's already a Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman. Jason asks if he's okay with him running with Artemis and Bizarro, which he is. Jason asks him one last question; if he is hungry. As they eat Bruce says that there are enough heroes in the world, and that having Outlaws wouldn't hurt. When Bruce asks, what happened to Roman, it turns out he left him the care of Ma Gunn.<\/p><h3>How Do You Solve a Problem Like Bizarro?<\/h3><p>With Black Mask out of the picture, his men have been trying to fill the power vacuum. Setting up a meeting with some of his old flunkies who sold drugs to the homeless, Jason offers them a chance to get out of the business and leave Gotham. They respond by training all their weapons on him, and they ask him how he plans to deal with them. He tells them he won't do anything, but his friend will. Bizarro then leaps into action and the two begin beating up the gangsters. When Bizarro comes close to killing one of them, Jason has to remind Bizarro to be more gentle, reminding him of how Batman got on him when he was too violent. Once they finish everyone off, their boss calls in backup in the form of <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/killer-croc\/4005-3725\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3725\">Killer Croc<\/a>. Jason is confused, knowing that Croc was drafted into the Suicide Squad. That moment of confusion gives Croc time to send Jason flying. Bizarro catches him, but in a fit of rage that his friend was hurt, Bizarro freezes Croc's head solid knock his head clean off before Jason can tell him not to. However, it was an android and not the real Croc. With no one left to fight, the two leave, but before they do, Jason stops Bizarro and asks him if he knew Croc wasn't alive. He tells him he did, but Jason isn't entirely convinced.<\/p><p>When the get back to Ma Gunn's old orphanage, now the Outlaws base, Jason talks to Artemis about what happened. Jason feels guilty for reprimanding Bizarro, and he asks if it's crazy for him to fell that way. Artemis tells him that anyone other than him would be crazy. Jason thinks that Artemis doesn't really care about Bizarro, having been searching for a lead on the Bow of Ra, but she is being serious. She then shows him videos she found while hacking into <a href=\"\/lexcorp\/4060-51472\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51472\">LexCorp<\/a> using a program created by someone in the <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/batman-family\/4060-60093\/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-60093\">Bat-Family<\/a>. Jason is offended that she doesn't think he created it, even though he didn't create it. Getting back on topic, Artemis shows him several videos of the scientists responsible for creating Bizarro, revealing that Bizarro is only one of many Bizarro clones, leaving a warning as to how dangerous Bizarro truly is, and capturing Lex Luthor ordering the clones' destruction. After seeing a video of a Bizarro clone killing a scientist, Jason wonders if it's too risky to trust Bizarro, but Artemis tells him that the question he needs to worry about is whether he can do the right thing if he becomes to dangerous; kill Bizarro before he kills us. Jason is reluctant, but Artemis reminds him that while their lives are just as important as Bizarro's, they have an obligation to the innocents who can't protect themselves from someone like Bizarro.<\/p><p>Pondering Artemis's words, Jason heads to the Batcave. Alfred comments that he always visits right after Bruce heads out, which is exactly how he likes it. Jason then asks Alfred if Bruce ever regretted taking him on as Robin. Alfred tells him that everyone always believed in him, no matter how bad things got. Jason asks Alfred to leave the cave and not tell Bruce he was here. Now alone, he gets what he came for; a shard of <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/kryptonite\/4055-32213\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">Kryptonite<\/a> with which to kill Bizarro.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5729687\" data-ratio=\"0.34724540901503\" data-width=\"1198\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1198px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:34.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static5.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5729687\"><img alt=\"Killing Bizarro?\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg 1198w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Killing Bizarro?\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg 1198w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5729687-killing+bizarro.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Killing Bizarro?<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Later, he and Bizarro head out into the country an sit on a lakefront Jason occasionally visits. Jason talks about his first time there, and how seeing it reminded him what a small part of the world he was. Bizarro tells him that he liked the world, even before he was freed from his container. He talks, with his back turned to Jason, about having Superman's memories implanted in his mind, and the real memories he has of Jason and Artemis. As he talks, Jason loads the Kryptonite, forged into a bullet, into a gun. As Jason aims the gun, Bizarro tells him that even though he isn't perfect, Jason showed him the path to being better, and promises to try to be the best version of himself. Moved by his speech, Jason holsters the gun and tells Bizarro it's time to go, but he asks to stay and enjoy the scenery a little while longer.<\/p><h3>Who is Artemis?<\/h3><p>Artemis and Jason are tracking a metahuman criminal and the two head into a bar their quarry frequents to find a lead. When the bartender refuses to talk about a patron, Artemis breaks a mug over another patron\u2019s head, instigating a bar fight. As she and Jason fend off everyone, Artemis hears someone address her as \u201csister.\u201d Artemis turns to see fellow Bana Amazon <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/akila\/4005-17679\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17679\">Akila<\/a> aiming a bow and arrow at her. Shocked to see her dead friend, she freezes. Jason notices and knocks Akila out, revealing that it was their target using his power to take the form of someone from her memories. Concerned at how she reacted to their quarry\u2019s powers, Jason asks about what she saw. Pouring a drink for herself, she dismisses him. When he insists, she relents and tell him about the origin of the Bana and her story.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5737547-brinn021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5737547\" data-ratio=\"0.58763837638376\" data-width=\"1084\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1084px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static4.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5737547-brinn021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5737547\"><img alt=\"A Man and an Amazon walk into a bar...\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5737547-brinn021.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5737547-brinn021.jpg 1084w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5737547-brinn021.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5737547-brinn021.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Man and an Amazon walk into a bar...\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5737547-brinn021.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5737547-brinn021.jpg 1084w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5737547-brinn021.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5737547-brinn021.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A Man and an Amazon walk into a bar...<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>While she tells her story, Jason asks about the rumors that all Amazons live on Themyscira, and that they will die if a man sets foot there. She corrects him, explaining that no one would die if they did, and that her ancestors left the island after a falling out with Hippolyta. They eventually reached the Middle East and asked the Egyptian Gods for sanctuary. Under some difficult terms, they traveled to the site where they would build Bana-Mighdall. She continues her story about her friend Akila, who would become the Shim'Tar, how she was driven mad by the power of the Bow, and how she met Wonder Woman when she arrived to stop. Jason asks about the outcome, Artemis gives a vague answer. However, he already knows what happened; the two were forced to kill Akila and Artemis holds herself responsible for everything that happened. The Bow of Ra was lost, so they assumed the gods took it. However, she found out that the Bow is still on Earth, and she has dedicated herself to finding it. As the two leave the bar with their quarry, Jason compliments her eyes. Unflattered, she responds by threatening to punch him in his face.<\/p><p>Using information that Jason got from Black Mask, the Outlaws head to the place where the buyer of the Bow of Ra resides and the one place on Earth Jason never wanted to see again: Qurac. Stealing a decrepit cargo plane, Jason has Bizarro fly it into Quraci airspace while he and Artemis watch a news-feed. According to the news, Quraci General Ahmed Hienle had just leveled the city where his political rivals where stationed. Though no one knows what weapon he used in the attack. Artemis recognizes the destruction as the work of the Bow of Ra. However, she can't understand how a man like Heinle could have harnessed its power when only Shim'Tar can wield it. Jason theorizes that he found a way, but she feels that no man can be trusted with such power, and that if the Bow really is in use, she failed her best friend.<\/p><p>When Jason makes a move to console her, the aforementioned General hails their plane and demands that they turn back. Jason boldly refuses, and vows that that Red Hood and the Outlaws will shut him down. When the general scrambles fighters to shoot them, down, they manage to hit Bizarro. Unharmed, Bizarro lets go of the plane to take the jets down, leaving Jason and Artemis to fall out of the sky. As they fall, Artemis complains about using a plane that can't fly. Jason retorts that he needed to make Bizarro feel like a part of the team. He also noted that Bizarro sparing the pilot proves they are making him a better person. Before they can crash, Bizarro catches the plane, but a light bright enough to obscure the night sky then shines, obscuring everything.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5800867\" data-ratio=\"0.68056713928274\" data-width=\"1199\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1199px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static3.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5800867\"><img alt=\"Of All the Places...\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg 1199w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Of All the Places...\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg 1199w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5800867-of+all+the+places.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Of All the Places...<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When he comes to Jason, he finds that he is in the frozen wreckage of the plane.

Before he can get moving, armed soldiers train their rifles on him.<\/p><p>Jason is stripped of his weapons and taken to a prison.

However, when he looks out the window, he sees that he is standing a few hundred feet from the remains of the building he died in.

The two the hear someone cry and out, and find that Bizarro is apparently dead.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5951419-loss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5951419\" data-ratio=\"1.5375\" data-width=\"1200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11129\/111292076\/5951419-loss.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5951419\"><img alt=\"The Loss of Bizarro\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5951419-loss.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5951419-loss.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5951419-loss.jpg 624w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5951419-loss.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Loss of Bizarro\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5951419-loss.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/11129\/111292076\/5951419-loss.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11129\/111292076\/5951419-loss.jpg 624w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11129\/111292076\/5951419-loss.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Loss of Bizarro<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Returning to Gotham to try to treat the dying Bizarro, <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/ma-gunn\/4005-30350\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30350\">Ma Gunn<\/a> tells the Outlaws that she is ill equipped to treat an alien clone, and anyone who can will not help them since their adventure in Qurac earned them the the status of international war criminals. Jason tries to give Bizarro some hope of survival, but Artemis argues against lying. The argument is cut short when they see <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/solomon-grundy\/4005-8342\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8342\">Solomon Grundy<\/a> rampaging on the news. Artemis tries to go face Grundy alone so Jason can be with Bizarro. As someone experienced with Grundy, Jason accompanies her anyway. The two reach Grundy, but both are quickly defeated. Before they can be killed, Bizarro, having heard their plight with his super-hearing, arrives to defeat Grundy knowing the gesture will end him. Against Jason's objection, Bizarro defeats Grundy, then collapses. With his last breaths, he asks his friends to care for his rag doll before dying. Jason is unwilling to accept that he is gone forever, but Artemis convinces him to simply mourn him and honor his last act. While mourning, the two are knocked out from a blast delivered by <a href=\"https:\/\/comicvine.gamespot.com\/lex-luthor\/4005-41952\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\">Lex Luthor<\/a>, Bizarro's creator.<\/p><h4>Meet the newest outlaw...Nightwing?!<\/h4><p>The one-shot story kicks off by showing some men on a cruise ship. Everything seems to be fine, until all of sudden KGBeast \"the Beast\" shows up and bombs the place to its ashes.<\/p><p>Moving on to Gotham City, we see Dick Grayson a.k.a. Nigtwing among the audience watching (at the circus) a spectacular show orchestrated by none other then Jason, Bizarro and Artemis. Jason asks Dick for a favor. He asks whether Dick could help them with the Russians.<\/p><p>At first, Dick hesitates a bit, but he realizes that he cannot let his brother alone and says yes.<\/p><p>They eventually follow the villain with all the evidence they have. It seems that it is the Beast!<\/p><p>It takes the four of them to beat him, but they eventually manage to win.<\/p><p>Jason and Dick shake hands and Dick tells him that he is glad that Jason is a good brother to Bizarro. Because frankly, Jason does a better job than Dick<\/p><h2>Powers and Abilities<\/h2><p>After being taken in by Bruce, Jason received an excellent education and tutoring from both private tutors and Bruce. He has deep knowledge in many subjects including: Science, Math, Medicine, Geography, Criminology, World History and English. As a former Robin, Jason Todd possesses all the skills of someone trained by Batman but lacked the experience of Dick and Tim. After his resurrection, Jason furthered his knowledge in combat by using Talia Al Ghul's fortune to travel the world similar to what his former mentor did, but sought out much deadlier training. Talia also paid for Jason's tutoring in explosives, strategy, poisons, weapons, vehicles, stealth, antitoxins, and surveillance. Jason has trained his body to peak physical condition, being physically superior to most Olympic athletes but that may be due to the healing of the Lazarus Pit. He has returned to Gotham and proved to be an extremely dangerous martial artist. Jason's fighting style focuses on brutality, strength, and speed; he is shown to have studied over half-a-dozen fighting styles and has proven to be a master of Aikido, Capoeira, Karate, Ninjutsu, Savate, Krav Maga, Kickboxing, and Tae Kwon Do. With these skills, he maintains his place as one of DC's top martial artists. Jason Todd could be considered one of the deadliest people in the world.<\/p><p>Jason has a particular taste for deception, and leaves traps for his enemies including: explosives, automated gun turrets, or electrical charges.<\/p><p>Jason's most notable weakness is his rage. Batman and numerous others have told him that his rage blinds him in battle to the point of leaving physical and mental weak points open for attacks. Recently, Jason has made steps to putting the past behind him and has become a more disciplined and controlled fighter as a result of recalling his time with the All-Caste.<\/p><p>Jason also has some magical powers such as materializing swords.<\/p><h3>Equipment<\/h3><h4>As Robin<\/h4><p>Jason received the costume worn by Dick Grayson during his tenure as Robin. The Tunic offers little to no resistance against gunfire. He has a yellow cape, green shorts, and green pixie boots. His utility belt consisted of Batarang, grappling hooks, gas pellets and other bat-related gadgets.<\/p><h4>As Red Hood<\/h4><p>After his resurrection and return to Gotham, Jason used the guise of Red Hood. The first costume consisted of Jeans, T-Shirt, Biker Jacket, A domino mask that is held in place by Spirit Gum, and The Red Hood Mask. His mask contains a Radio Transmitter and Receiver as well as Night Vision. He has Gauntlets that contain compartments for his weapons, which are deadlier. His weapons of choice are a pair of customized Jericho 941's, fitted with extra serrations and mini red dot sights, an assortment of shurikens, and a flame dagger, a replica of one of Ra's Al Ghul's weapons.<\/p><p>His second costume has the Red Hood Mask, which is still metallic, although it appears to have been modified. He wears a white and Grey costume which also comes with a cape. In the middle of his chest is a Red Skull. He uses lethal force by means of his two red pistols.<\/p><p>The third version of the costume is similar to the first with the exceptions of a red bat emblem on the chest, a brown biker jacket and a more form fitting mask with Jason's mouth visible and a distinct absence of a domino mask underneath instead he has a mask like his old Robin mask under the hood. Jason's new outfit possesses tech and weapons inside it similar to the Batman Beyond suit. So far shown are glider wings housed in the forearms and a grappling hook with reticle aimer on the left forearm. Jason's helmet or \"hood\" provides a moderate degree of protection. When a Talon stabbed it with a knife cracking it, Jason was shocked that a knife was able to do that and stated that no knife should able to crack his hood. Also, Jason used a dosage of <a href=\"\/venom\/4055-47184\/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-47184\">Venom<\/a> while on a mission with Supergirl.<\/p><p>His most recent suit consists of the standard biker jacket, jeans and metallic mask. However, he now wears an armor like shirt with the red bat emblem. He also modifies his attire with technology regularly, with one suit containing retractable blades along the arms. His most recent suit has a taser powerful to stun an Amazon while on a low charge. He also wields pistols that fire normal bullets along with other types of ammo such as sedative injectors and anti-tank rounds.<\/p><p>In most, if not all instances, Jason usually carries a firearm with him. He usually only carries dual pistols with him, but will use whatever gun he feels suits his purposes.<\/p><h4>As Red Robin<\/h4><p>This costume consists of a Red Tunic with gray pants. The utility belt is larger and contains circular throwing discs. The cowl is much like Batman's, minus the ears. The cape also seconds as a glider.<\/p><h4>As Batman<\/h4><p>His costume is a very militaristic version of the Bat-Suit. Features heavy armor in both gray and black. The ears are shorter, and there is no opening by the mouth, but is protected by an armored covering instead. His lenses were tinted red to strike fear into the criminals. He carries two pistols and his utility belt is seen to have other lethal weapons. Much like the Red Hood mask, Jason wears a domino mask under the cowl as well.<\/p><h2>Characteristics<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/543896-01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-543896\" data-ratio=\"0.7231467473525\" data-width=\"661\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 661px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/543896-01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-543896\"><img alt=\"Jason Todd: Back from the Dead.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8190\/543896-01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/543896-01.jpg 661w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8190\/543896-01.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jason Todd: Back from the Dead.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8190\/543896-01.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8190\/543896-01.jpg 661w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8190\/543896-01.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Jason Todd: Back from the Dead.<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li><b>Height:<\/b> 5'11\"<\/li><li><b>Weight:<\/b> 175 lbs, 190 lbs, 200 lbs or 225 lbs (depending on the source).<\/li><li><b>Eyes:<\/b> Blue or Gray (depending on the colorist); green in the Animated Version of Batman: Under The Red Hood.<\/li><li><b>Hair:<\/b> Black (it was red in Pre-Crisis continuity and was briefly restored in regular continuity, until the Flashpoint revamp set it back to black).<\/li><li><b>Unusual<\/b> <strong>Features:<\/strong> Jason briefly had a gray streak or sometimes a white streak in his hair from his revival from the Lazarus Pit, but this feature was later dropped altogether from the character as it made him look much older than what was intended.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Other Versions<\/h2><h3>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns<\/h3><p>In <a href=\"\/frank-miller\/4040-7082\/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7082\">Frank Miller<\/a>'s critically acclaimed graphic novel, Jason Todd had died in the line of duty.

As they were unable to locate him, Jason was missing and presumed dead. Some time later, once the Joker is cured from his insanity, Harley brings up the presumably deceased Jason. The Joker (as Jack Napier in this continuity) says that he doesn't remember what happened to the second Robin.

This version is voiced by Jensen Ackles, while his younger versions of Robin are voiced by Vincent and Alexander Martella. His first Robin costume is the same one used by Dick Grayson and his second is the later version of Tim Drake's with small changes such as the length\/style of the cape, and dark green coloring instead of black. In the film, Jason is kidnapped and beaten half to death by the Joker in a warehouse while Batman is racing to save him on his Batcycle, but is unable to get to him in time as the building explodes after the Joker leaves. Batman holds Jason in his arms, in grief.<\/p><p>Five years after, the Red Hood arrives to Gotham and sets up a meeting with the city's drug dealers and makes a deal with them: if they give him 40% of their earnings, he will give them protection under one condition, no dealing to children or the Red Hood would kill them. Red Hood get's Batman's attention after the Dark Knight fights an Amazo but gets away. Black Mask is angered that his Amazo was destroyed and wants the Red Hood taken out, meanwhile Red Hood hijacks one of Black Mask's helicopters and confronted by Batman and Nightwing, chasing him over the city. Batman recorded the chase and discovers that Red Hood knows his identity.<\/p><p>Black Mask starts attacking the Red Hood's business areas and sends assassins (the Fearsome Hand of Four) after him but Batman manages to arrive and the two fight them off together, and Red Hood kills one of them. After the fight, Red Hood explains that he is in Gotham to clean it up better than Batman ever did, by controlling crime instead of fighting it.<\/p><p>Batman gets a blood sample of the Red Hood from a sword used in the fight and finds the DNA matches Jason Todd, finding out that Ra's Al Ghul resurrected Jason through means of the Lazarus Pits out of guilt for hiring the Joker and setting him loose, costing Jason's life in the first place. Jason returned to life but was mentally unstable and threw himself out of a window, presuming him dead but managed to survive and make his way to Gotham.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1216276\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1216276-rh1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.3875\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:38.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1216276-rh1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1216276\"><img alt=\"Attempt on Black Mask.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1216276-rh1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1216276-rh1.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/62058\/1216276-rh1.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1216276-rh1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Attempt on Black Mask.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1216276-rh1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62058\/1216276-rh1.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/62058\/1216276-rh1.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.comicvine.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62058\/1216276-rh1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Attempt on Black Mask.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After Black Mask hires the Joker, Joker turns against his employer and ties him and his men up in a truck to be set ablaze.

Batman manages to pull both out in time, but after the explosion, Jason disappears. The ending scene is a flashback in which Jason Todd is shown to be excited to be Robin for the first time, in which he exclaims : \"This is the best day of my life\", as a ironic approach to the final outcome in Jason Todd turning into the Red Hood.<\/p><h4>Batman movies (1990's)<\/h4><p>In this adaptation of the Batman universe, Dick Grayson's character has anger issues and grudge against Two-Face much like Jason Todd.

Jason Todd is revealed to be 'The Arkham Knight', which is the 2nd antagonist in the game. The Arkham Knight was Jason Todd who was kidnapped by the Joker and tortured and shot by the Joker in 'Arkham Asylum', The Joker sent videos of Jason's death to Batman to get to him. Joker brainwashed Jason to hate Bruce and even get close enough to telling him Batman's identity before Joker shot Jason Todd; sending that video to Batman, making Bruce think Jason is dead. When Bruce then takes Tim Drake under his wing, it infuriates Jason Todd which he dons The Red Hood persona and later dons The Arkham Knight persona which he alliances with Scarecrow to takeover Gotham and break &amp; kill Batman. He forms a militia,; trains them in the way that Batman trained himself and designed a more high-tech bat suit for himself with gadgets and weapons. With the Arkham Knight's suit, it's ears are supposed to mock Batman's and the Arkham sign written over his chest is supposed to keep the events of Arkham franchise in Bruce's head.<\/p><p>The Arkham Knight reveals his identity to Batman during their last confrontation. Bruce explains himself and tries to reach out to his broken former partner, seemingly to no avail. Batman wins the battle and Jason disappears.<\/p><p>In the final act of the main story, Bruce surrenders to Scarecrow in exchange for the latter sparing the lives of Robin and Commissioner Gordon. Jason tracks him down and, just when Scarecrow is about to execute Bruce, Jason intervenes and saves his former mentor, allowing him to take down Scarecrow and rescue his allies.<\/p><p>In a DLC set after the events of Arkham Knight, you can play as him in his Red Hood persona against Black Mask and his organization.<\/p><p><ins><strong>Heroclixs Board Game<\/strong><\/ins><\/p><p>in 2008 a seres called Crisis. Jason Todd as the Red Hood was made in the series with his hand on the mailbox jumping with a aussult rifle in his hand to attack. He was also made in the Teen Titans pack in 2013 of the DC New 52 pack holding a Japanese samrai sword and a gun and standing on a roof of a buliding.<\/p><p><ins><strong>Injustice: God's Among Us<\/strong><\/ins><\/p><p>Although not officially a playable character in the game yet (it was rumored that Jason Todd would make an appearance as a DLC character later on however it was confirmed that Lobo, Batgirl, Zod, Martian Manhunter, Scorpion, and Zatanna were the only ones) there are a few references to Jason Todd all of which ironically come from the <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/joker\/4005-1702\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker<\/a> himself. In the game one of Joker's main weapons is his infamous crowbar likely the same one used to bash in Jason Todd's skull in the storyline <a href=\"\/a-death-in-the-family\/4045-42218\/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42218\">A Death in the Family<\/a>. Another reference that further proves this claim is dialogue used by Joker within the storyline when <a href=\"\/\/www.comicvine.com\/damian-wayne\/4005-42413\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42413\">Damian Wayne<\/a> compares Joker to Batman to which Joker denies. Surprised Damian asks if Joker is a hero in his alternate world to which Joker cheerfully responds: <em><strong>\"Oh no dear boy. It's just that.. Batman likes to corrupt young minds while I bash them out of their<\/strong> <strong>skulls.\"<\/strong><\/em>, and obvious nod at the death of Jason Todd once more. The final connection to Jason Todd in the game is Joker's alternate \"Red Hood\" costume. Joker originally was the first one to don the red helmet and cape, but Jason Todd is the one who currently dons the alias so the connection is undeniable.
